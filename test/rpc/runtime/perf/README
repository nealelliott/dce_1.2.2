Perf Test Suite
============================================

The perf tests has to be run as two different processes - 
a perf server and a perf client. The perf server need to be started
before a perf client process can be invoked.

Various RPC request combinations can be tested as input to
perf client process.

The following scripts are provided to execute a minimal set
of perf tests:
	run_client.sh (can be run with both tcp and udp).
	perf_udp.sh
	perf_tcp.sh

Usage of these scripts:
run_client.sh `string binding returned by server`
perf_udp.sh server_host_name client_program_directory
perf_tcp.sh server_host_name client_program_directory

Before executing any of these scripts, a server need to started
with appropriate protseq_spec.

An example run  of these scripts involve starting the server:

        ./server 1 ncadg_ip_udp
              ==> returns binding, such as ncadg_ip_udp:130.105.4.102[2001]
         run_client.sh 'ncadg_ip_udp:130.105.4.102[2001]'
	 perf_udp.sh server_host_name .
or 
        ./server 1 ncacn_ip_tcp
              ==> returns binding, such as ncacn_ip_tcp:130.105.4.102[2001]
         run_client.sh 'ncacn_ip_tcp:130.105.4.102[2001]'
	 perf_tcp.sh server_host_name .

The alternate methods of executing the perf tests are provided 
in the DCE Porting and Testing Guide.

=========

As of OSFDCE1.2.2, servers may register with the "User to User" protocol,
where they only need access to a login context, not a keytable, to be the
receivers of authenticated RPCs.

To use perf with "User to User":

  1) Create an account for the server: (eg: perf_svr)
  2) Set the dupkey and usertouser flags to yes, with dcecp for this account.
  3) dce_login to perf_svr, then run the server:

    ./server -u perf_svr 1 ncadg_ip_udp

  4) Log in to any client account and run the client:

    ./client -p default,dce,pkt_integrity 0 ncadg_ip_udp:<ipaddr>\[<port>\] 1 1 yes no

  5) To verify ticket refresh with u2u, set the max ticket lifetime on the
     dce-ptgt account to 7 minutes and run the client with the following
     arguments:

    ./client -p default,dce,pkt_integrity 0 ncadg_ip_udp:<ipaddr>\[<port>\] 10000 100 yes no

    This should run for a long time, and you can verify that it makes it
    through several ticket lifetimes (which you set to 7 mins each) before
    killing it.
