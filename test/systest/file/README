############################################################################
# This directory contains automated tests and checklists for system testing
# dfs. The automated tests are:
# dfs.glue
# dfs.lock
# dfs.read_write_all.main
# dfs.block_frag
# dfs.maxfile
# dfs.maxdir
# Each of these accepts as arguments a datafile. The first 3
# are CHO tests, the last 3 support specific stress objectives.
# You must edit the datafiles based on your cell configuration. 
# Sample datafiles for each, respectively, are:
# glue.data
# lock.data
# dfs.read_write.data
# block_frag.data
# maxfile.data
# maxdir.data
# Please read the syntax section of the test scripts for more details.
# The file README.RWALL contains all the necessary information on how to run
# the dfs.ream.write_all.main test.
#
# NOTE 1: All the tests expect to find test files under TROOT on all the
# machines. The test files must be either installed or NFS mounted
# below TROOT.
#
# NOTE 2: All the automated CHO tests require rsh capability between all the
# dfs machines, both as Unix user root and as the Unix test user!
# See the /etc/hosts.equiv and home directory .rhosts files.
#
# NOTE 3: All the automated tests SHOULD be run as test users whose
# UNIX and registry uids and gids match. The dfs.read_write_all test 
# REQUIRES UNIX and registry uids and gids to match.
#
# NOTE 4: The dfs.glue test must be run as root and requires that unauthenticated 
# users (Unix users without DCE credentials) have RX rights to the DFS test directory!
# 	This means that the ACLs on the directory hierarchy must contain
# any_other:rx
#
# NOTE 5: The dfs.read_write_all and dfs.block_frag tests need to be run
# as cell_admin if root.dfs is in LFS. If root.dfs is a native 
# filesystem, run the add_root_as_admin.ksh script and then dce_login
# as DCE principal root.
#
############################################################################
#
# The checklists are:
# dfs.repfldb_checklist			(multiple fldb testing)
# dfs.repfs_checklist			(replicated fileset testing)
# dfs.sec.cross_bind_checklist		(acl testing cross-cell, bind NOT X.500)
# dfs.wan_checklist			(WAN testing)
#
# There is also a dfs admin checklist in:
# src/test/systest/admin/file/tests/admin_checklist
#
# The checklists are step-by-step instructions for testing commands and
# expected behaviors of the system. Example output is embedded in the
# checklists for verifying correct results for these hand tests.
