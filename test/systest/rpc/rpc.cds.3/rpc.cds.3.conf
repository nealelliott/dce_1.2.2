#
# ASSOCIATION
#    This file is part of the rpc.sec.2 DCE System Test.
# 
#    The rpc.sec.2 system test corresponds to test rpc.sec.2 in the DCE1.0.2
#    Core Component System Test plan.  For more information on the operation
#    and goals of the rpc.sec.2 system test, see the test plan, or the README
#    file in this directory.
#
#
# FUNCTION
#    This is the central configuration file for the rpc.sec.2 system test.
#    It is read by all of the shell scripts used to setup the DCE CELL for
#    running the rpc.sec.2 system test, and also by the client and server
#    programs at startup to get operational parameters such as principal
#    names, etc.  Note that since this file is read by the shell, it's contents
#    conform to shell syntax rules; ie: no space surrounding '=' signs, 
#    comments are delimited by '#', etc.  Lines in the file that are intended
#    for the client or server program must be in the form <string>=<string>.
#    The strings may not contain whitespace.  Comments may appear at the 
#    end of lines.
#
# CALLED BY
#   (Actually should be READ BY): All the setup shell scripts and the 
#   client and server programs.
