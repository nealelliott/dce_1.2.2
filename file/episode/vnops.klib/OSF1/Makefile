# 	Transarc delta: mason-add-hp800-osi-routines 1.15
# 	  Selected comments:
# 	    This delta is misnamed - these are really porting fixes.
# 	    Need to checkpoint to fix a different bug.
# 	    Checkpoint the first system where test_anode works.  Only one change is not
# 	    included here - the link line in anode/Makefile uses -lbsd.  On HP-UX, this
# 	    is -lBSD.  This should be fixed more generally.
# 	    More HP-UX changes.
# 	    More HP-UX related changes.
# 	    Fix compile problem on the RIOS.
# 	    Fix more compilation problems.
# 	    Checkpoint.
# 	    Checpoint.
# 	    In this snap we turned all malloc() calls into osi_Alloc calls.
# 	    Also turned free calls into osi_Free.
# 	    HP-UX EOF detection fix.
# 	    Another checkpoint.
# 	    This is a checkpoint of the first working HP-UX Episode system.
# 	    Reorganized files  - efs_mount is now split out.
# 	    Needed to add the vnops routines specific to HP-UX.
# 	    Fix compilation problems.
