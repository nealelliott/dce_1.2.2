# 	Transarc delta: comer-ot6297-icl-user-interface 1.5
# 	  Selected comments:
# 	    Added some functioanlity and a user interface to the ICL package.  The
# 	    current command is called dfstrace; the current interface is:
# 	    ./dfstrace: Commands are:
# 	    apropos         search by help text
# 	    clear           clear logs by logname or by event set
# 	    dump            dump DFS trace logs from the kernel
# 	    help            get help on commands
# 	    lslogs          list available logs
# 	    lssets          list available event sets
# 	    setlog          set the size of a log
# 	    setset          set state of event sets
# 	    Usage: dfstrace clear  [{-set <set_name>... | -log <log_name>... | -all}]
# 	    [-help]
# 	    Usage: dfstrace dump  [{-set <set_name>... | -all | -follow <log_name>}]
# 	    [-file <output_filename>]
# 	    [-sleep <seconds_between_reads>] [-help]
# 	    To get a continuous dump of a log, for example, do:
# 	    dfstrace -follow cmfx -sleep 5
# 	    Usage: dfstrace lslogs  [{-set <set_name>... | -log <log_name>... | -all}]
# 	    [-long][-help]
# 	    Lists logs, their sizes, and whether or not they are currently
# 	    allocated.
# 	    Usage: dfstrace lssets  [{-set <set_name>... | -all}] [-help]
# 	    Lists available sets and their states.
# 	    Usage: dfstrace setlog  -log <log_name> -buffersize <4-kilobyte_units>
# 	    Set log size.
# 	    Usage: dfstrace setset  {-activate | -deactivate | -release}
# 	    [{-set <set_name>... | -all}] [-help]
# 	    Change the state of an event set.  In active state, logging
# 	    occurs to log.  In inactive state, no loggin occurs but the
# 	    reference to the log persists.  In the released state, the
# 	    reference to the log is gone, so the log may be deallocated.
# 	    Added shell script so that tests calling icldump will still continue
# 	    to work.
# 	    Misc bug fixes.
# 	    logp->logElements wasn't getting reset on clear.
# 	    By default icl tracing is turned on.  This change makes it a little
# 	    easier to turn it on and off when compiling.  The change adds 2 flags:
# 	    ICL_DEFAULT_ENABLED and ICL_DEFAULT_DISABLED.  There is an accompanying
# 	    -D in icl and icl.klib Makefiles, currently both enabled.
# 	Transarc delta: shl-add-copyrights-to-new-files 1.1
# 	  Selected comments:
# 	    Added OSF copyrights and other header stuff
