This directory contains the source for the remote authentication
programs dfs_login and dfs_logout. They are part of the DCE/DFS
Gateway.  

In order to build these programs you will need to acquire sources for
Kerberos 5 (beta 4). Install this directory of sources under your
Kerberos build tree in .../krb5/src/clients/dfs_login . An Imakefile
is included with this source distribution. To create the Makefile, "cd
.../krb5/src/clients/dfs_login; ./configure".  Then type "make". 

You will also need to copy over the dfsgw.h file from the dfsgwd directory to
.../krb5/src/clients/src/clients/dfs_login.

Refer to the DCE/DFS Administration guide for further information on
installing anc configuring dfs_login and dfs_logout.
