# 	release to their DCE 1.1 release.

# 	This delta removes the multiple-level recursion in WriteLocked.  The
# 	recursion is now at most only two deep.
# 
# 	This was inadvertently left out.  I needed it to verify that I hadn't broken
# 	basic recovery.

# 	The NBS changes meant that there could be many pages which didn't really need
# 	I/O.  The existing simplistic algorithm was merrily reading and writing those
# 	pages even though no data on the pages was modified.  To fix this, we merely
# 	defer the I/O until we find a transaction really needing to write on the data
# 	page; once found we keep it around.  At the end we check to see if we ever
# 	read it.  If so, we write it back to disk. If not, we just go to the next
# 	modified disk block.
# 
# 	This first delta is a checkpoint.
# 
# 	New test script.

# test deferal of i/o (NBS-style) - this test tries to ensure that the
# undo-zero transaction has committed & the defer code really works.  Recovery
# should report that NO undo-fill records were processed!

# which starts an undo-zero tran on an unrelated block.
