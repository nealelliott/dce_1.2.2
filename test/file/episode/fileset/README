Test description

fsettest00 
    Very simple test that exercises basic correctness of efts
    operations like attach, create, delete, detach and epimount and
    epiunmount

fsettest01  
    Tests basic operation of efts clone and reclone

    Specific env vars:
        NUMITER - number of iterations 
				default: 10

fsettest02
    Tests efts clone and reclone with file operations (cthon) being
    done synchronously.

    Specific env vars:
        NUMITER - number of iterations 
				default: 10

fsettest03
    Also tests efts clone and reclone with file operations (cthon) being
    done synchronously. It differs from test02 in that clones and reclones
    are done alternately.

    Specific env vars:
        NUMITER - number of iterations 
				default: 200
