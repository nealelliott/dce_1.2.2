This file explains how to run the tests for the DFS file exporter.

Currently the only tests available for the DFS File Exporter are the stress
test located in the scripts/stress directory.

NOTE:
	1) You MUST be logged in as root to run this test program.
	2) This test program assumes a single configuration.
	3) This test program currently assumes the standard DCE configuration.
	   That is it looks for DFS server principal names in the
	   /.../<cellname>/hosts directory in CDS.
	4) Make sure you edit the fileset name in the config file, if not using
	   root.dfs.

STRESS -

  There is only one stress script.  To run this test cd to the test
  install directory for the FX test program.

    <sandbox>/install/<platform>/dcetest/dce1.0/test/file/fx

  You can run the test in batch mode as follows.

    ./fx_test -I scripts/stress/stress1.itl

  You can run the test in interactive mode as follows.

    ./fx_test

    (After some time you will see the prompt)
    Do> 

    At this prompt enter,

    Do> include scripts/stress/stress1.itl

  Notes:
	The default configuration assumes that the principal's "root" and
	"cell_admin" exist in the security registry and have their default
	passwords.

	You can control this test by editing the stress1_config.scr script.
	You can change the number of threads it creates, the size of
	the files it creates, etc.  This file documents all of the variables
	it makes available to the user.

	Multiple instantiations of the test program can be run concurrently.
	If you do this you must set the multiplePrograms variable in the
	stress1_config.scr script to true.  Running multiple instantiations
	of the test program can cause RPC timeouts, i.e. it can generate
	a serious load rather quickly.

	If you desire the run the script concurrently on more than one target
	fileset, make sure you edit the fileset name in the stress1.config
	script.

	Be sure you have enough disk space available.  If you are running
	5 threads and the maximum file size is 5MB, then you will potentially
	need 25MB of disk space.

	Do not redirect the output of the test script into LFS. This may cause
	permission problems and the script may fail because the scripts 
	call dce_login to assume different identities. A preferable location
	to redirect would be to local disk, say /tmp.
