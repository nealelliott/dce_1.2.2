<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>High Level Design - Infrastructure -- Queue Features</H1>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>
<EM>August 21, 1998</EM>
</P>

As described in the model, queues are managed by queue managers. A queue
manager is a standard DCE server, managing queues and serving requests for
operations on queues. There can be any number of queue managers
running in the environment. In this section, we describe the features
with queues.
<P>

<H2>Multiple Queue Support</H2>

Each queue manager is capable of supporting multiple queues. Each of the
queues can be configured so that certain principals can use it. The
number of queues a queue manager can have depends on the physical resource
limitation (virtual memory for example).
<P>

This multiple queue support makes it possible to configure just one queue
manager in the system and still provide the full support that our
queuing system can offer. 
<P>

<H2>Queue Name and Alias</H2>

Each queue has a name that is relative to the queue manager. In other word,
the queue name is a junction name composed of the queue manager's name and
a relative name. For example, a queue named "cf/hotline" on the queue manager
"/.:/subsys/queues/osf-qmgr1" has a complete name of
"/.:/subsys/queues/osf-qmgr1/cf/hotline".
<P>

A queue can have multiple aliases, also relative to the queue manager. We
further allow the user to have CDS links to point to the queue manager. For
example, a user can create a cds link "/.:/my_qmgr" to point to
"/.:/subsys/queues/osf-qmgr1" and create an alias for the queue "cf/hotline"
as "hotline". He can then reference the queue by the name of
"/.:/my_qmgr/hotline".
<P>

<H2>Finding A Queue Manager For An Application</H2>

For applications that want to send or receive messages from a known queue,
finding the queue manager that manages the queue is done by the APIs. The
applications does not need to know where to find the queue manager.
<P>

For applications that want to create queues for their use, they need to
supply additional information for APIs to locate a queue manager for
the queue creation operation. The application can either name the
queue manager directly by its NSI name, or it can use a default queue
manager.
<P>

There are several ways to specify a default queue manager, searched in
the following order:

<OL>
  <LI>from the environment variable MOS_DFLT_QUEMGR_NAME
  <LI>from the per host default queue manager specification.
       <BR>
       This can be either from a per host profile where a list of queue
       managers can be specified. The name is /.:/hosts/$HOSTNAME/msg.profile.
       Or it can be from a per host data element (hostdata object) managed
       by the DCE Daemon (dced).
  <LI>from the per cell default queue manager specification from
       /.:/cell-profile.
</OL>

The DCE profile is good for this purpose because it allows the user to
specify priority to guide the ordered search. The priority can be set based
on certain criteria: availability, closeness, etc.
<P>

Once a queue manager can be reached, the application can use APIs to create
queues for its use and export those queues for other applications to talk
to.
<P>

<H2>Load Distribution Among Queue Managers</H2>

By allocating different queue managers to different hosts and
applications, an administrator can achieve static load distribution
among queue managers. 
<P>

<H2>Scalability Support</H2>

The queuing system can be scaled up or down to suit for the
application environment.  
<P>

If the environment does not have many applications running, the system
can be scaled down to even one queue manager. On the other hand, for a large
environment where there are many messaging applications running and they
scatter across different places on the network, it is possible to configure
many queue managers and use profile to allocate the "right" queue
manager for each application.
<P>

<H2>Queue Ordering</H2>

The queue order defines how messages on the queue are sorted for dequeue
operation, which normally takes a message from the top of the queue. 
<P>

In our design, messages are sorted based on their priorities, 
then sorted based on their enqueue time (FIFO) within a priority level. 
<P>

<H2>Queue Persistency</H2>

A queue's persistency determines whether and how it saves messages. A queue
creates persistent storage to save messages. A
persistent queue always saves all its messages, including volatile ones.
A volatile (non-persistent) queue never saves any message. Sending a
persistent message to a volatile queue will result in an warning and the
messages is treated as volatile.
A conditional persistent queue only saves persistent messages, but not
volatile messages. This is the default behavior of a queue if nothing is
explicitly specified.
<P>

This persistent attribute can be changed after the queue has been created..
<P>

A queue manager can start with an option to restore from its or specified
persistent storage. An administrator can also instruct a queue to be
restored from its persistent storage.
<P>

<H2>Queue Attributes</H2>

Each queue can have certain attributes. These attributes have their default
values. They can be set at the queue's creation time, they can also be
modified later programmatically or through an administrative interface. This
allows for dynamic configuration of a queue.
<P>

<H3>* Maximum Length</H3>

Each queue has a size which defines how many messages it can keep. When the
maximum is reached, a non-blocking enqueue operation returns with an error
indicating that the queue is full. A blocking enqueue operation is blocked
until the queue is not full any more. If there are multiple blocking
enqueue calls, they are sorted based on their arrival time.
<P>

The queue size can be changed programmatically, or through an
administrative interface.
<P>

<H3>* Current Length</H3>

This is a read-only attribute for a queue. It shows the current length of
the queue. Note, this is not to be confused with queue size, which specifies
the maximum length of a queue.

<H3>* Maximum Message Size</H3>

This determines the maximum size for a message that this queue will take.
Max length and max message size together defines the maximum space
requirement for the queue.

<H3>* Empty Idle Expiration</H3>

This attributes control how long a queue should be kept alive when it is
empty before it is to be deleted by the queue manager. The default is
24 hours.

<H3>* Ability To Enqueue and Dequeue</H3>

A queue can be disabled or enabled for either enqueue or dequeue
operation. When an operation is disabled, such requests will be rejected. 

<H3>* Annotation</H3>

A queue can have an annotation which can be used to describe the use/purpose
of the queue. This attribute is not interpreted by the queue manager.
<P>

<H3>* Creation And Last Activity Timestamp</H3>

These two are read-only attributes for a queue. The creation timestamp
records when the queue is created; the last activity timestamp records
the queue's last activity time.
