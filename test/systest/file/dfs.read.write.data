#
# This file contains the data needed to run the test dfs.read_write_all.main.
# Before running this test, the data in this file needs to be revised so that
# corresponds to the DFS environment where the test is going to run. 
# For instance, the test will fail if the the aggreate information does not 
# correspond to that found by the fts command and so others.


# 1- Server, Aggregate and Fileset information:
#        The following variables must have the same number of entries. The script
#        expects to find this order; each colunm represents a set of related values.
#        For instance, using the values listed below, it reads as follows:
#        lfs_aggr on dce13 has 100000 free kbytes that can be used to
#        create 2 filesets which will have mount points under
#        /:/dfsusers.

AGGR_NAMES="/d2"
AGGR_SERVERS="monk"
AGGR_SIZES="50000"
FILESETS_PER_AGGR="2"
FILESETS_QUOTA="5000"
BASE_MOUNT_POINTS="/:/dfsusers"

# 2- Client information
#	The following variable is a list of dfs client machines to participate in test.
#	Machine entries may include AGGR_SERVERS. All MACHINES must contain the
#	machine that will host the test in their /.rhosts file.

MACHINES=""

# 3- User and group information
#	This information is used to created local and registry accounts for
#	users.

BASE_UID=201
GROUP_ID=1001
BASE_USER_NAME=dfs_
DFS_USER_PWD=-dfs-
NUMBER_OF_USERS=2
GROUP_NAME=dfs

# 4- Test operational options
#    The following variables are expected to have a TRUE or FALSE
#    value. 

TRUE=1
FALSE=0
SETUP_RGY_ACCOUNTS=TRUE
CREATE_FILESETS=TRUE
POPULATE_USER_ENV=TRUE

# 5- Test home directory 

#TROOT="/dcetest/dcelocal/test/systest/file"
TROOT="/d2/users/white_r/test"

# 6- Common files to copy to the users home directories if POPULATE_USER_ENV=TRUE.

USER_PROFILE=profile
TODO_SCRIPT=do.ksh

# 7- Log information
#	COMMON_LOG_DIR path must be visible and read-writable by all MACHINES (either via DFS or NFS)

COMMON_LOG_DIR=/:/testlogs
COMMON_LOG_FILE=/:/testlogs/read_write.log
LOCAL_LOG_DIR=/tmp/logs

# 8- Clean up information
#	Set DELETE_FILESETS, DELETE_RGY_ACCOUNTS accordingly with CREATE_FILESETS, SETUP_RGY_ACCOUNTS for 
#	subsequent runs in the same cell. Set to TRUE or FALSE.

DELETE_FILESETS=TRUE
DELETE_RGY_ACCOUNTS=TRUE
DELETE_COMMON_LOGFILE=FALSE
DELETE_LOCAL_LOGS=FALSE
