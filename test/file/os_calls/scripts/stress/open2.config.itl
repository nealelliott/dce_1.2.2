* Following arrays act as procedure arguments.
*
* loopCount - defines the number of times to execute this test.  It also
*             defines the number of entries in the fileSizes, rangeLock and
*             middleLock arrays.  The script loops this many times, 
*             accessing the corresponding values in the arrays defined below.
*
*             NOTE:
*               All arrays are assumed to start at index 0.
*
* fileSizes - array of sizes of files to create.  Locks are placed on ranges
*             within these files.  So make sure the rangeLock and middleLock
*             arrarys are in sync with the values in this array.
* rangeLock - defines the locks obtained by the DFS path process in this test.
* middleLock - defines a lock range that lies within the boundaries of the
*              rangeLock.  This lock range is used to hollow out a portion
*              of the corresponding rangeLock.  It is used by the local path
*              process in this test.
