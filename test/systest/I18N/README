        I18N Tests
        ==========
 
        The files I8NSAN001 and I8NSAN002 found in this directory are the I18N 
        tests. These tests were written as dcecp scripts and are run under TET. 

        Following are the files and directories that make up the test.
	
            README              this file.
            lib                 a directory containing files that define common
                                 procedures called by the test main procedure.
            tet_code            file containing error definitions known by TET.
            tet_scen            TET scenario file.
            tetexec.cfg         file containing test configuration variables and
                                 assignments.
            ts                  a directory where the main test scripts reside.


	Purpose
	-------

	The purpose of the I18N tests is to provide a general and simple approach 
	to test I18N support in the CDS and Security components. 
	
	Prerequisite set up
	-----------------------

        Before attempting to run the I18N tests, do the following:

        1. Select a locale for testing and prepare the message catalogs
           corresponding to that locale.

        2. Make sure that the host machine's operating system has I18N
           support for the desired locale.

        3. Edit the value of the variables defined in the
               
               tetexec.cfg

           file. For example:

               LOCALE_NAME=c-french 
               MESSAGE_CAT=/u1/piglatin/%N
               LOCALE_DATAFILE=french.short

           The above settings mean that the test will use the French locale,
           and will look for message catalogs in the

               /u1/piglatin

           directory.

        4. Set the following environment variables:

               TET_ROOT
               HOME

        5. Create the datafile defined by the environment variable
           LOCALE_DATAFILE. This is the input file to the tests. It
           should contain a list of at least 20 words, arranged one
           per line.

        6. Install and configure the DCE cell.

        7. Install and configure the system tests using dcetest_config.
           For information in dcetest_config, see the OSF DCE Porting
           and Testing Guide, Chapter 13.


        Test execution
        --------------

        Use the following TET commands to execute the tests:

            tcc -e -j <journal_file> system/I18N I8NSAN001

            tcc -e -j <journal_file> system/I18N I8NSAN002

        After the test has executed, the results will be found in the
        journal file (which you specify). If a journal file is not speci-
        fied, TET will create the file under the

            results

        directory.
