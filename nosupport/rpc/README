Restricting Network Address Advertising
=========================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

An administrator can restrict which network addresses of servers will be 
advertised in the namespace and endoint-map. The following steps describe 
the procedure.

1. Configure the host.
2. Set the environment variable RPC_SUPPORTED_NETADDRESS. This variable
   controls the restriction and is located in the /sbin/init.d/dce script. 
3. Export RPC_SUPPORTED_NETADDRESS variable for each invocation of the 
   server that will be restricted.
                                  
The runtime looks for RPC_SUPPORTED_NETADDRS. If this environment variable 
is set, only addresses in the IP network addresses list will be advertised 
in the namespace and endpoint map. Addresses not found on the list will be 
excluded from the server's list of available addresses.

The format of the RPC_SUPPORTED_NETADDRS string is:

  RPC_SUPPORTED_NETADDRS=protseq:netaddr[,protseq:netaddr]

After you set the environment variable, export it. You can specify either
the hostname or its IP address. For example, if you specify a host named
myhost or its IP address, 10,3.2.1, then the exported environment variable 
will force any server started in the current shell to support only the 
addresses associated with the name myhost and network address 10.3.2.1.
