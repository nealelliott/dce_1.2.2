#    This is the first pass at automating tests for the bak savedb command.
# They work with expect-4.3.  They will need to be updated to work with
# expect, version 5.
#
# Initial checkin.

   The numbering of the savedb tests in this directory agree with the
numbering of the bak checklist
(/afs/transarc.com/project/fs/dev/dfs/test/dfs/doc/checklist/bak.checklist).
The pertinent portion of that file is presented below.  Asterisks(*) denote
tests and preceeding dashes(-) indicate tests that are not implemented yet.
