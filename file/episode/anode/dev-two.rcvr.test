# 	Transarc delta: ota-ot3802-deflate-needs-tlock 1.2
# 	  Selected comments:
# 	    The basic problem here is that epit_Deflate does not grab the volume's
# 	    tlock (since there is not volume_table tlock) and so it doesn't merge
# 	    with transactions that deleted files from the pages being deflated.
# 	    The conditions actually required to reproduce this problem in practice
# 	    are pretty damn obtuse.  That these changes actually accomplish this,
# 	    however, proves that they are not impossibly obtuse.  This first
# 	    revisions just allow that reproduction.  The actual bug fix will be in a
# 	    subsequent revision.
# 	    Basically moved Deflate function from volume_table.c where there is no
# 	    appropriate tlock to volume.c where it can grab the same tlock that
# 	    Delete uses.
# 	    Fixed title line.  Added copyright, header.
