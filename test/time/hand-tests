These are test provided to OSF by Digital Equipment Corp. for DTS.
They are intended to be run by hand in the configurations specified
in the tests.

Certain test required the system clock to be set forward or back large
amounts of time (more than 10 minutes).  Since the DCE version of DTS
uses the DCE Security Service, DTS will lose authentication when this 
occurs and be unable to perform its RPC calls.

It is possible to build DTS without DCE security, which would allow
these tests to be done.  See the DCE Porting and Testing Guide for more
information.

          Time Server Experiments


          These tests consist of verifying various types of function-
          ality of DTS clerk /server communications. Attention should be
          paid to the behavior of both the clerk and the server to deter-
          mine the effects of during steady-state operation and dynamic
          changes. All clerks/servers will have dts servers required set
          at the default setting of 3 unless a change is specified.

          1. Verify that clerks do not favor certain local time servers
             but that the selection is random. This test will be repeated
             20 times and will consist of synchronizing against 3 out of 6
             servers to verify that server selection is distributed among
             available servers. This test will also verify that clerks
             synchronize with the minimum number of local time servers.

             1,Insure 6 DTS servers exist on LAN
               ( On a clerk execute the following commands )
             2, dtscp> synch
             3, dtscp> show local server
             4, Verify that random servers are used in last synchronization
                by repeating steps 2,3 and observing local server info.

          2. Verify that clerks do not favor certain global time servers
             but that the selection is random. This test will be repeated
             20 times and will consist of synchronizing against 3 out of 6
             global servers to verify that server selection is distributed
             among available servers. All servers will be global servers.
             This test will also verify that clerks can request time from
             global time servers when the minimum number of time servers
             are not present in the local set.
             
             1,Insure 3 or more DTS Global servers exist on LAN
               and that only one local server exists on LAN.
               ( On a clerk execute the following commands )
             2, dtscp> synch
             3, dtscp> show global server
             4, Verify that random servers are used in last synchronization
                by repeating steps 2,3 and observing local server info.

          3. Verify that clerks will resynchronize with a server when
             there is not the minimum number of time servers (both global
             and local) present. The minimum number of servers will be set
             to 3 (default) on the clerk and only 1 time server will be
             available on the network. The clerk should resynchronize when
             the dts servers required is set to 1 on the clerk.

             1, Insure there are less than 3 DTS servers on LAN
                ( on a Clerk execute the following commands)
             2, dtscp> set servers required 4
             3, dtscp> synch
	     4. dtscp> show state   ( see note 1)
             5, dtscp> show local server
             6, Verify clerk synchronized with some server more than once
             7   by observing server used in last synchronization = True.
             8, dtscp> set servers required 1 ( on one server )
             9, remove other 2 of the 3 servers.
            10, dtscp> synch ( on clerk )
            11, dtscp> show too few servers detected
            12, verify too few servers detected incremented
            13, dtscp> set servers required 1 
            14, dtscp> synch ( on server then clerk )
            15, dtscp> show local server
            16, Verify clerk synchronized with existing server. 

          4. Verify that clerks will reschedule a time request when there
             is not the minimum number of time servers (both global and
             local) present. The minimum number of servers will be set to
             3 on the clerk and only 2 time servers will be available on
             the network.

          5. Verify that time servers can be moved to a new epoch and
             synchronize only with servers in that epoch. This test will
             consist of setting 1 of the 6 servers to a new epoch and
             drastically changing the time value. Then adding a new server
             to the new epoch one by one. Once 4 of 6 servers are in the
             new epoch, the other servers should not be able to resynch
             due to the minimum numbers of servers being absent in the old
             epoch. It is important to examine the operation of clerks;
             specifically, how long does it take for the clerks to settle
             down to the new epoch and what is their transient behavior.

          6. Verify that 4 time servers (all w/o a timeprovider) are
             operational. One of these servers is modified to included
             a time provider. Once upgraded it is determined that DTS
             time does NOT include UTC, so a new epoch is declared. 
             Examine the operation of clerks; specifically, how long
             does it take for the clerks to settle down to the new epoch
             and what is their transient behavior.

          7. Verify that a clerk will determine a faulty server and ex-
             clude it from the synchronization process.

          8. Examine the scenario of 6 servers of which two are faulty.
             The faulty servers intersect with one another, so a clerk
             which queries the two faulty servers will synchronize to
             the incorrect time. Assuming prompt intervention on the part
             of the network manager (ie, responding to the logged event)
             what are the dynamics of the scenario in terms of the clerk
             synchronization process.

          9. Verify that servers will determine when a number of server
             are consistently out of time synch with the majority of
             servers.

          10.Verify that clerks will solicit a time request upon boot.

             1, reboot system
             2, observe DTS info messages on startup
             3, dtscp> show local server 
             4, verify that a synchronization occurred with some servers
             
          11.Verify that clerks will periodically flush the global server
             list.

          12.Verify that servers will solicit a time request upon boot.

             1, reboot system
             2, observe DTS info messages on startup
             3, dtscp> show local server
             4, verify that a synchronization occurred with some servers

          13.Verify that servers will periodically flush the global server
             list.

          14.Given a scenario where a synchronized network (without a time
             provider) drifts from UTC. Examine the dynamics that occur
             when a time provider is introduced into the network.



          Time Skew Experiments
          
          This test will consist of introducing inaccuracy to a clerk's or
          server's internal clock. Verify that the clerks and servers 
          resynchronize. 

          1. Verify that a clerk's slow clock is speeded up to resynch
             with the server. Set the clerk's clock 20 seconds back.

          2. Verify that a clerk's fast clock is slowed down to resynch
             with the server. Set the clerk's clock 30 seconds ahead.

          3. Verify that when a clerk's time tolerance error is exceeded,
             the time is set to a new time value which is in synch with
             the server. Set the clerk's clock 4 hours ahead.

          4. Verify that when a clerk's time tolerance error is exceeded,
             the time is set to a new time value which is in synch with
             the server. Set the clerk's clock 2 hours back.

          5. Verify that when a positive leap second is declared , that a
             clerk's time inaccuracy is increased by the leap second.

          6. Verify that when a negative leap second is declared , that a
             clerk's time inaccuracy is increased by the leap second.
             
          7. Within the DTS algorithm, leap seconds are already ac-
             counted for, that is they are declared to occur at the end of
             each month. However, leap seconds do not necessarily occur
             each month with respect to a time provider. Verify that if a
             leap second is declared, that with the use of a time provider
             which doesn't declare a leap second as having occurred, that
             the 1 sec inaccuracy that is introduced by the algorithm is
             removed when synching with the time provider.

          8. Verify that a server's slow clock is speeded up to resynch
             with other servers. Set the servers clock 15 seconds back.

          9. Verify that a server's fast clock is slowed down to resynch
             with other servers. Set the server's clock 20 seconds ahead.

          10.Verify that when a server's time tolerance error is ex-
             ceeded, the time is set to a new time value which is in synch
             with the other servers. Set the server's clock 2 hours back. 
	     Set the server's clock 4 hours ahead.

          11.Verify that when a positive leap second is declared , that a
             server's time inaccuracy is increased by the leap second.

          12.Verify that when a negative leap second is declared , that a
             server's time inaccuracy is increased by the leap second.

          13.Verify that when the time service is enabled, the DCL SET
             TIME command doesn't work by attempting to set the time to a
             drastically different value.

          14.Verify that when the time service is disabled, the DCL SET
             TIME command does work by attempting to set the time to a
             drastically different value.

          15.Verify that a clerk can synchronize with a time server that
             is in another time zone. Set 2 of the servers to be in the
             +5 time zone, 2 of the servers to be in the +4 time zone,
             and the other 2 servers to be in the -1 time zone. Then
             selectively remove 3 servers so that the minimum of 3 servers
             are each in separate time zones. The clerk will be in time
             zone +3.

          16.Verify that a server can synchronize with a time server that
             is in another time zone. Set 2 of the servers to be in the +5
             time zone, 2 of the servers to be in the +4 time zone, and
             the other 2 servers to be in the -1 time zone.


          Courier Experiments
          
          These experiments will verify that the courier functionality of
          servers operates as it is intended. Local servers are configured
          on the same LAN, while global servers are configured on a 
          separate LAN.

          1. Set all local servers to be non-couriers and verify that no
             local server can synchronize with a global server.

             1, dtscp> set courier role noncourier
             2, dtscp> synch 
             3, dtscp> show global server
             4, verify no global servers were used in last synchronization.
             
          2. Set all local servers to be couriers and verify that local
             courier servers always synchronize with a global server.

             Insure that some global servers and local servers exist on
             LAN

             1, dtscp> set courier role courier
             2, dtscp> synch 
             3, dtscp> show global server
             4, verify global servers were used in last synchronization.

          3. Verify that a local server (backup courier) cannot synchro-
             nize with a global server when another local server has the
             courier attribute set to courier.

             Insure that some global servers and local servers/couriers
             exist on LAN
             
             ( execute the following on one server )
             1, dtscp> set courier role backup courier
             2, dtscp> synch 
             3, dtscp> show global server
             4, verify global servers were not used in last synchronization.


          4. Verify that a local server (backup courier) cannot synchro-
             nize with a global server when it's datalink address is not
             lower than another server with the courier attribute set to
             backup courier.

             Insure that 2 local servers and one global server exist in
             LAN and the two local servers are backup couriers.
             dtscp> set courier role backup courier

             ( execute the following on one server )
             2, dtscp> synch 
             3, dtscp> show global server
             4, check if global servers were used in last synchronization.
             ( execute the following on other server )
             5, repeat 2 - 4 on other local server and verify that one of
                the servers synchronized with a global server and its
                datalink address was higher than the others.

          5. Verify that a local server (backup courier) always synchro-
             nizes with a global server when no other local servers has
             the courier attribute set to courier.
             

          6. Verify that a local server (backup courier) always synchro-
             nizes with a global server when no other local servers has
             the courier attribute set to backup courier.

          7. Verify that a local server (backup courier) always synchro-
             nizes with a global server when it's datalink address is the
             lowest among other servers with the courier attribute set to
             backup courier.


          Exception Experiments
          
          These tests will ensure that event logging takes place for
          unexpected events and that meaningful messages are displayed.

          1. Verify a clerk can synchronize with a local server after the
             clerk's power is turned off and then on again.

             1, Insure that 3 local servers are available on the LAN,
             2, Turn off, then on, a clerk.
             3, Verify DTS synchronization from system startup messages.
             (Once the clerk has started up execute the following command
              from DTSCP on the clerk to verify that all 3 servers
              have synchronized with clerk)
             4, dtscp> show local server 
   
       2. Verify a clerk can synchronize with a local server after the
             server's power is turned off and on again.

             (On a server turn the power off then on. Then
              on a clerk, execute the following command from
              DTSCP)
              1, show local server  (to verify that clerk synchs 
                                           with server) 
   
             
        3. Verify a clerk can synchronize with a global server after a
             clerk's power is turned off and on again.

             1, Insure that the clerk has access to at least 1 global server
             2, On a clerk, turn power off then on.
             3, Verify clerk's synchronization upon startup from system
                startup messages.
                  

         4. Verify a clerk can synchronize with a global server after the
             server's power is turned off and on again.

             1, Turn the power of a global server off and then on
             (On a clerk, execute the following commands from 
              DTSCP once the server is up again)
             2, dtscp> synch 
             3, dtscp> show global server (to verify if clerk synchronized
                               with server)

          5. Verify all clerks can synchronize with servers after the all
             systems in a network have the power turned off and on again.

          6. Verify servers can synchronize with other servers after the
             all systems (servers)in a network have the power turned off 
             and on again.
       
              1, Verify that the DTS servers required parameter is set to 
                 the maximum number of local servers available on LAN
              2, Turn power off and then on on all availble servers on the
                 LAN
              (Once systems are started-up, from the DTSCP command on each
                 system execute the following commands)
              3, dtscp> show local server  (to verify that all
                                 servers available have synchronized 
                                 with that server)
                                    
          
          7. Attempt to communicate with a system which was a global time
             server but is no longer registered in the name space.

             Remove the global server from the CDS directory.

             (On a DTS server, execute the following commands from dtscp)
              1, dtscp> synch 
              2, dtscp> show global server  (to verify that global server
                      which was deleted from CDS does not communicate)

          8. Attempt to communicate with a system which was a global time
             server but is no longer a time server.

             (On a server which is a global server, execute the 
              following command from dtscp)
              1, dtscp> disable
             (On another servers, execute the following from dtscp)
              1, dtscp> synch
              2, dtscp> show global server (to verify if global
                                            server is not responding)

             
          9. Disconnect the thin wire connection from the clerk and
             attempt to communicate with a global server which is not
             reachable.


          10.Do not register any servers in the name space and set the
             minimum servers parameter to be 1 greater than the number of
             local servers. This will cause the DTS code to access the
             name space in search of a global server.


          11.Attempt to access the name server to find a global server but
             the name server denies access.


          12.Attempt to communicate with a server when the circuit cost
             exceeds the max value.


          13.Attempt to communicate with a server when the number of hops
             exceeds the max value.


          14.Attempt to communicate with a server when there are no pro-
             cess slots available.


          15.Attempt to communicate with a server when the maximum number
             of logical links are already active.


          16.Have 6 time servers in the network (3 in each of two dif-
             ferent epochs) and attempt to synchronize when the minimum
             number of servers is set to 4.


          17.Have no time servers in the network and attempt to synchro-
             nize when the minimum number of servers is set to 1.

             Insure that no time servers are available.
             (On a clerk, execute the following commands from dtscp)
              1, dtscp> set servers required 1
              2, dtscp> show all char (to verify servers required has been

          18.Have 6 time servers in the network and attempt to synchronize
             when the minimum number of servers is set to 7.
             
             1, Insure that 6 local time servers exist on the LAN.
                (On a server, execute the following from dtscp)
             2, dtscp> set servers required 7
             3, dtscp> synch 
             4, show local server (to verify that server synchronized
                               with 7 servers)
           
          19.Have 30 time servers on the LAN and attempt to synchronize
             when the clerk's minimum number of servers is set to 30.

          20.Have 30 time servers on the LAN and attempt to synchronize
             with all 30 time servers..




	Note 1.
	-------
	On the tests in which servers are unavailable, ie test 3 of the time
	server experiments, because the dtscp 'synch' command returns before
	the synch completes, there may be a timing window in which subsequent
	commands can return before the actual synch completes.
	If you issue a dtscp> show state  and state comes back with 'on', 
	then the synch has completed and furthur commands will behave 
	properly, ie:
	
	dtscp> set serv requ 4
	Servers Required    =    4
	dtscp> synch
	dtscp> show state
	State               =    on
	dtscp> show/set do whatever, the synch is definitely done
