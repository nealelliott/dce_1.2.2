The script "runall" is a wrapper for a higher level script that runs
the cm tests automatically.

Overview:
---------

CM commands are issued by administrative users to update cached information
on local workstations. This directory contains the CM command test suite that 
exercises all CM subcommands.

Privilege and environment settings: 
------------------------------------

The DFS file test util and cm directories are required, i.e.
test/file/{cm, util}.

Also, the permission on the root directory of the DFS file tree (/:)
must have read/write/execute permission for the person executing this
test suite.  The suite attempts to create a file in this directory.

Running the tests:
------------------

You must execute this test suite from the parent directory of the cm
directory where the tests are actually located.  So to run the tests you
issue the command, "cm/runtests".

Depending on the login name the runtests script will run one of two sets of 
tests.  One set is for a root login, and the other is for a non-root login.
For the root login the test set includes, test1, test2, test3, test5, and 
test6.  For the non-root user the set includes, test1, test2, test4, test5, 
and test6.
