		
			REPLICATION TEST PLAN

This plan tests underlying replication functionality.  It does not make
exhaustive tests of the replication-related FTS commands.

Sumary: rtest1, rtest2, rtest3 = about 50 pages of shell procedures.


PART 1. Single-server testing.  Limited to one replication site,
	scheduled replication only.  No peer-to-peer tests.


			A. BASIC TESTS:

TEST_SS_B_001:

	DESCRIPTION:

		   to create a replicated pair, and create xxx and
		   xxx.RO mount points for the related filesets.

	STATUS:

		1. Done, rtest1 and rtest2.
		2. Also tests release replication.

TEST_SS_B_002:

        DESCRIPTION:

		1. Create short (< 100 byte), medium (1024 < blocksize),
		   long (>= blocksize) files in xxx and ensure that they
		   are propagated eventually.

	STATUS:

		1. Done, rtest1 and rtest2.

	STATUS:

		1. Done, rtest1 and rtest2.

TEST_SS_B_005:

        DESCRIPTION:

		1. Use ``ls -R'' and ``diff'' to test for unexpected

	STATUS:

		1. Done, rtest5.

TEST_SS_B_011:

		1. Done, rtest5.

TEST_SS_B_013:

        DESCRIPTION:

TEST_SS_B_016:

        DESCRIPTION:

		1. Invent a pair of processes, the ``mutator'' and the
		   ``checker'', where the mutator makes lots of
		   modifications within a fileset, and the ``checker''
		   can tell whether those modifications are consistent.
		   Allow the mutator to run on the R/W of a replicated
		   pair of filesets, and allow the checker to run on the
		   R/O.

	STATUS:

		1. TBD.

	communication.  Call the two file servers A and B.


			A. BASIC TESTS:

TEST_TS_B_001:

        DESCRIPTION:

		1. Scheduled replication.  Set up a R/W fileset

	STATUS:

		1. Done, rtest3.

TEST_TS_B_002:

        DESCRIPTION:

		1. Ensure propagation with all the mechanisms above
		   (fts lsreplicas, fts lshead, diff, ls -R).

	STATUS:

		1. Done, rtest3.

TEST_TS_B_003:

        DESCRIPTION:

		1. Remove one of the replicas (fts rmsite) and see if
		   replication continues.

	STATUS:

		1. Done, rtest3.

TEST_TS_B_004:

        DESCRIPTION:

		1. Done, rtest6.

TEST_TS_B_008:

        DESCRIPTION:

		1. Try to tell which replica a CM is using (perhaps with
		   different ``maxsiteage'' parameters).  Make
		   unavailable the replica that's in use and see if the
		   CM fails over to the other replica.  The replica
		   might be made unavailable with ``fts rmsite'' or by
		   crashing or halting the server, or by halting the
		   repserver (so that the token lifetime is expired).

	STATUS:

		1. TBD.

TEST_TS_B_009:

        DESCRIPTION:

		1. Move the source R/W fileset from one server to
		   another, and see if the repservers track it
		   correctly.

	STATUS:

		1. Done, rtest6 (disabled).

TEST_TS_B_010:

        DESCRIPTION:

		1. Use ``fts update xxx -all'' to request a immediate
		   repserver update on all servers.  Verify that the
		   update request propagates correctly from the
		   first-contacted repserver to the other repserver(s).

	STATUS:

		1. Done, rtest3.

TEST_TS_B_011:

        DESCRIPTION:

		1. Release replication.  Set up a R/W fileset xxx to be
		   release-style replicated.

	STATUS:

		1. Done, rtest3.

TEST_TS_B_012:

        DESCRIPTION:

		1. Add a distinguished (local) R/O site and see if it's
		   reachable from a CM.

	STATUS:

		1. Done, rtest3.

TEST_TS_B_013:

        DESCRIPTION:

		1. Add a distant R/O site (off the primary) and see if
		   it updates.

		1. Make changes to the R/W and verify that none of the
		   R/O filesets changes.

	STATUS:

		1. Done, rtest3.

TEST_TS_B_015:

        DESCRIPTION:

		1. Release the replica and verify that the distinguished
		   R/O fileset changes immediately.

	STATUS:

		1. Done, rtest3.

		1. Verify that the update-yourself-now message is passed
		   correctly from site to site.

	STATUS:

		1. TBD.

TEST_TS_B_018:

        DESCRIPTION:

		1. Verify that CMs correctly fail over to available
		   sites.

	STATUS:

		1. TBD.

        DESCRIPTION:

		1. Combinations.  Try changing a replication scheme from
		   release-style to scheduled-style, and vice versa.

	STATUS:

		1. Done, rtest3.


			B. ERROR TESTS:

TEST_TS_E_001:

        DESCRIPTION:

		1. Ensure that you can't remove the distinguished
		   replica from a release-replica scenario until all
		   other replicas are removed.

	STATUS:

		1. Done, rtest6.

TEST_TS_E_002:

        DESCRIPTION:

		1. Try changing a replication scheme from
		   scheduled-style to release-style when there's no
		   replica on the R/W machine (and thus there's no
		   distinguished replica).  This should fail gracefully.

	STATUS:

		1. Done, rtest6.
