# Revision 1.1.2.2  1993/01/28  21:34:39  shl
# 	Transarc delta: rajesh-ot6318-acl-recovery-test 1.7
# 	  Selected comments:
# 	    Test recovery for correct restoration of acls.
# 	    Another checkpoint since I am upgrading to dfs-102-2.2.
# 	    Needed to import another delta.
# 	    Since the acl tests should not be run as root, but checkaggr needs
# 	    to be run as root, modifications were needed. The main program acldriver
# 	    is to be invoked as root, with the name of the local/DCE user to run the
# 	    ACL tests as specified via an environment variable. The user's DCE passwd
# 	    is specified likewise. The remaining programs are invoked as necessary.
# 	    The acldriver perl script "su"s as the user specified and executes this script.
# 	    This bsh shell script dce_login's as the DCE user specified and executes
# 	    runacltest2.
# 	    Add support for running multiple copies of ACL tests on different
# 	    filesets in the same aggregate simultaneously.
# 	    Debug support code added in previous revision of this delta.
# 	    Miscellaneous changes to increase robustness and quality.
