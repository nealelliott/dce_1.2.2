		REPLICATION TESTS

The "runtests" command will run these tests without arguments and
without user intervention. When run in this manner, the rep tests
configure themselves automatically, complete in about 2 hours (1) and
generate about 85 kbytes of log info. The rep tests comprise rtest1,
rtest2, rtest3, rtest5 and rtest6 (rtest4 was never completed and is
never used). The subset of tests to be run can be changed through the
variable "def_tests" in the "runtests" script. I execute the "runtests"
script logged in as root and as cell_admin. I copy the tests into LFS
in the test cell before running the script. I use a test cell that
contains two LFS file exporters, each exporting two LFS aggregates.
I allow the scripts to auto-configure. Alternatives for running the
rep tests by hand are described below.

The "runall" script is a wrapper for "runtests" that manages logs
and is convenient for a higher level script to call.

(1) However, this depends on the size of the aggregates used.

(The following holds for the original reptests: rtest1, rtest2,
and rtest3 - NOT for rtest5 or rtest6.)

Version 1.0
-----------

This file gives some details about the replication-specific fts tests and
explains how to run them.

The replication test driver is the file called runtests.  It is a script that
takes a few options on the command line and acts accordingly.  It runs tests
1 through 4 which test various replication features.  The runtests script
has simple help facilities for the command line options.  For example:


	$ runtests -help
	Usage: runtests [-nt <iter>] [-np <procs>] [-server1 <host>]
	[-server2 <host>] [-help]

nt is the number of iterations running tests 1 through 4.  np is the number of
processes running the rep tests (1 through 4) simultaneously, server1 is the
name of the first server machine (eg. paradox), and server2 is the name of the
second server machine.

Tests 1, 2, and 4 may be performed using only one file server machine.  Test 3
requires two distinct file server machines.  All file server machines must be
running the DFS file server exporting at least one DCE LFS (Episode) aggregate,
and they must also be running the DFS fileset server and the DFS replication
server.

These tests will, by default, auto-configure to a certain extent, examining
the membership of the subsys/dce/dfs-admin group to locate one or two DFS file
server machines and executing the ``fts aggrinfo'' command to locate one or
two DCE LFS aggregates on those file server machines.  The auto-configuration
choice of servers may be overridden by providing arguments on the ``runtests''
command line.  Alternatively, the auto-configuration choice of servers and/or
aggregates may be overridden by the use of environment variables SERVER_1,
SERVER_2, EPI_AGGRNAME_1, and EPI_AGGRNAME_2.  When setting these variables,
remember that SERVER_1 must export DCE LFS aggregate EPI_AGGRNAME_1, and
SERVER_2 must export DCE LFS aggregate EPI_AGGRNAME_2.

The runtests driver can be invoked from any directory.  That is, PWD need not
be within DFS, so you don't have to copy the tests into DFS space.  Typically,
the test scripts are stored somewhere in the source hierarchy, and you could
invoke runtests directly from here.  A log is maintained in PWD (the directory
from which the tests were invoked).  This can be overridden by setting the
environment variable REP_LOG_HOME to a particular directory (eg. /tmp).  The
log file is created in the directory indicated by REP_LOG_HOME.  The default
is the directory from which the runtests driver was invoked.  The log contains
details about the PASS/FAIL status of each test(1 through 16).  There would
also be messages about which test failed indicating by an error number
(eg. E87).  Looking for this error code in the test script would show which
particular command failed.  Alternatively, the REP_VERBOSE environment
variable can be set to "ON", and this causes the shell script to execute in
verbose mode, dumping each script line into the log file.

The tests can be run with server1 and server2 being either RS/6000 (AIX) or
DS 3100/2100 (OSF/1).

New tests added: rtest5 (single server) and rtest6 (two servers).
See replication checklist for specification of the new tests.
