V2test Test Suite
============================================

The v2test tests has to be run as two different processes - 
a v2test server and a v2test client. The v2test server need to be started
before a v2test client process can be invoked.

Various RPC request combinations can be tested as input to
v2test client process.

The following scripts are provided to execute a minimal set
of v2test tests:
	v2test_udp.sh
	v2test_tcp.sh

Usage of these scripts:
v2test_udp.sh server_host_name port_number client_program_directory
v2test_tcp.sh server_host_name port_number client_program_directory

Before executing any of these scripts, a v2server need to started
with appropriate protseq_spec.

An example run  of these scripts involve starting the v2server:

        ./v2server 1 ncadg_ip_udp
              ==> returns binding, such as ncadg_ip_udp:130.105.4.102[3285]

        ./v2test_udp.sh server_host_name 3285 .
or 
        ./v2server 1 ncacn_ip_tcp
              ==> returns binding, such as ncacn_ip_tcp:130.105.4.102[3611]

        ./v2test_tcp.sh server_host_name 3611 .

The alternate methods of executing the v2test tests are provided 
in the DCE Porting and Testing Guide.
