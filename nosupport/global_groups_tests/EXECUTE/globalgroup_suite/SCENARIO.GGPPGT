Details for propagation testing

    Verify the propagation of GlobalGroup operation to the replica servers
    in the cell.  Details are in ATTACH 1.

    In this section, the trigger of propagating the registry database is
    typing commands manually.
    It is difficult to replace above method to convenient scripts.
    Nevertheless we can execute verifying part by scripts.

    Basic test plan of this term is:
    - verify if global principal member operations items are propagated
      to the slave replicas
    - verify if global principal members are re-created on the slave replicas

GLOBALGROUP TEST SCENARIO (propagation testing)

1. Prerequisites

    Propagation tests require two cells consisting of three nodes at
    minimum.  One cell must have a master and a slave replica server, and
    the other cell must have a master replica server.

	cL	local cell (cell on the local host).
		This cell will have a master and a slave replica server.
	cR	remote cell (cell on the remote host)


2. Test Scenario
2.1 Setting up test condition

    Create a group and an account into the local cell like bellow;

	dcecp> group create gG
	dcecp> principal create pL
	dcecp> account create pL -group none -organization none

	- gG means a group object which will include foreign principals
	- pL means a principal object which belongs to the local cell

    Create an account into the remote cell like bellow;

	dcecp> principal create pR
	dcecp> account create pR -group none -organization none

	- pR means a principal object which belongs to the remote cell

    After this operation, enable the cells to show each name space using
    "dcecp cdscache create", and connect to remote cell using
    "dcecp registry connect".

    NOTICE:
	In each scenario, the timings when the slave replica server should
	be configured are different from each other.
	So we don't configure the slave replica server at this time.


2.2 Details for testing

    Here are scenario diagrams for propagation testing.
    In the diagrams below, `GG operation' means to modify registry database
    by adding or removing global principals as a group member.
