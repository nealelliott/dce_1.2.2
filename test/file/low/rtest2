# 	Transarc delta: jess-ot5320-fix-fs-low-testhome 1.1
# 	  Selected comments:
# 	    The fs and low test shell scripts have the following if statement
# 	    if [ "$TESTTOP" = "`pwd`" ]
# 	    then
# 	    UTIL_DIR=../util
# 	    testhome=$TESTTOP
# 	    else
# 	    UTIL_DIR=$TESTTOP/util
# 	    testhome=$TESTTOP/$testSuiteType
# 	    fi
# 	    The problem is that variable testSuiteType is not defined at this time.
# 	    See above.

# Revision 1.1.4.2  1992/08/28  18:16:31  jaffe
# 	Transarc delta: rajesh-clean-low-tests 1.5
# 	  Selected comments:
# 	    To remove make and clean options from the low test suite. To change
# 	    the scripts to use common shell functions. To create a file
# 	    fs_functionsScript with the common shell functions in the util
# 	    directory.
# 	    To remove make and clean options. To change the scripts to use common
# 	    shell functions from util/fs_functionsScript instead of inline code.
# 	    Modify scripts to follow coding standards, simplify the code, increase
# 	    readability etc.
# 	    No changes yet
# 	    More of above.
# 	    Modify the tests to give them a simpler logical structure, modularity,
# 	    readability ( one command per line) and to change then to use the
# 	    common function created earlier.
# 	    Modification of rtest1 and rtest2 to use the utility functions
# 	    correctly.
# 	    See above.

# Revision 1.1.2.4  1992/06/19  17:19:20  jaffe
# 	Transarc delta: rajesh-ot4304-low-rtest2 1.1
# 	  Selected comments:
# 	    low rprog2.c assumes that gid of files and dirs is the gid of the
# 	    creating process. On OSF1 the group id of created files and dirs are
# 	    that of the parent dir and not the process's group id. Fix the tests
# 	    to operate correctly for OSF1 platforms.
# 	    No change actually.

# 	Transarc delta: fred-3754-change-script-name 1.1
# 	  Selected comments:
# 	    To clean up a number of defects with the tests.  In addition to defect
# 	    3754, the changes also fix defects 3750 and 3748.
# 	    Fixed setting of TESTTOP variable.

# Revision 1.1.2.2  1992/05/21  12:47:28  jaffe
# 	Transarc delta: fred-merge-tests 1.1
# 	  Selected comments:
# 	    Created this delta to merge Phil Hirsch's final DFS test code changes with
# 	    the test code that the OSF had.  Hopefully, this means we and the OSF
# 	    should be looking at the same test code.
# 	    Changes to facilitate merge of local DFS test code with the OSF's.
# 	Transarc delta: fred-remove-sys 1.1
# 	  Selected comments:
# 	    To remove dependency on the AFS sys command in the test scripts.
# 	    To remove dependency on AFS sys command.
# 	Transarc delta: rajesh-low-rtest2-passuidgid 1.1
# 	  Selected comments:
# 	    To modify the rtest2 program so that rprog2.c does not need to be linked
# 	    with the libdce.a so that the same cc command can be used both under DFS and
# 	    AFS. Done by determining the uid and gid in the rtest2 shellscript and
# 	    passing it to rprog2.c, instead of letting rprog2.c using DCE security API
# 	    calls in DCE/DFS and system calls in AFS to do it.
# 	    Modified to pass uid and gid to rprog2.c. For DCE/DFS it uses klist program.
# 	Transarc delta: rajesh-low-tests-dfs-update 1.3
# 	  Selected comments:
# 	    To fix bugs and modify the low tests for DFS.
# 	    To provide for corect compilation of rprog2.c for DFS.
# 	    Change compile flag DFS to TR_DFS for rprog2.c
# 	    DCE security API call fixes

# This script runs a C program which tests chown() and fchown().
# This test will only succeed if run by root.

# Usage: rtest2 

# This script assumes the existence of rprog2.c in the current directory. If
# the $testhome variable is set, then the make option will attempt to copy
# it from there to the current directory. If $testhome and the current
# directory are different and both contain this file, then the clean option
# will remove it from the current directory.
