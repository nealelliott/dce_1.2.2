# 	Transarc delta: rajesh-ot5367-salvage-recovery-authorization-check-tests 1.8
# 	  Selected comments:
# 	    To add authorization check tests for salvage/recovery. This is
# 	    the initial checkpoint.
# 	    Just a checkpoint.
# 	    Another checkpoint.
# 	    Checkpoint.
# 	    This delta version has been tested.
# 	    Changed permissions.
# 	    Update makefiles.
# 	    Fixed logical errors in the script pertaining to requiring read/write
# 	    access to aggregate to perform salvage and/or recovery, handling
# 	    of error counts generated in the AuthCheckTest.noroot script.
# 	    Fix a build-time error.

# 	Transarc delta: bk-ot4454-util-fsSeySysVar 1.1
# 	  Selected comments:
# 	     To fix the bug in fs_SetSysVar utility test script.
# 	    The fs_SetSysVar function was not stripping a period (.) that results from
# 	    executing "cm sysname" command. So I added "sed ..." command to strip off
# 	    the period.
# 	Transarc delta: jess-change-default-system-setting-util 1.2
# 	  Selected comments:
# 	    It is more reasonable to set the default system as DFS in stead of AFS
# 	    in the file fs_SetSysVar of dir 'util'. This delta is the change of it.
# 	    Change the default system var as DFS.
# 	    Change the comment in the echo line.
# 	    "Assume DFS".

# 	Transarc delta: fred-3754-change-script-name 1.1
# 	  Selected comments:
# 	    To clean up a number of defects with the tests.  In addition to defect
# 	    3754, the changes also fix defects 3750 and 3748.
# 	    Correct name for old fs_SetSysName script.
