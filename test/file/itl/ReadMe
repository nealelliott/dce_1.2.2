Please Read:

The ITL directory is the directory containing the interactive
test library.  The library is build as several independent libraries.
The main one being libitl.a

libitl.a contains all the low level IO and control commands exported
by ITL.  In addition, each component may select to put a library, such
as itl_vol.a, that will export the commands of that component that may
be of general use.  You should not put in here code or commands that
are specific to a single test program.
All exported functions of a  component library should be prefixed with
itl{comp}_, e.g., itlVol_, itlTran_, or itlFile_.  In addition, each library
should contain one command called {prefix}_AddCommands (or
{prefix}_Add{Comp}Commands (e.g., itlVol_AddVolCommands).  That
function should be a void function that takes no parameter.  It should
initialize whatever is needed and should register all the commands it
exports with the itl command loop.

When you add a library or code, please write a short description
describing the function here and where to get more help if needed.

If you are making any significant changes to any of the libraries,
please summarize them at the end.
