# HISTORY
# $TALog: restoreft-12.3e,v $
# Revision 1.6  1996/01/21  09:48:31  hyer
# Changes to make the backup test scripts with the callout routines for
# mount and unmount in DCE 1.2.
#
# Added cm checkfilesets and cleaned up test to run with callout routines
# [from r1.5 by delta hyer-7265-backup-test-mods-for-callout-routines, r1.1]
#
# Revision 1.5  1995/12/06  15:25:19  hyer
# The backup test scripts were not working. Most of the tests either
# failed or never ran. Made significant changes to all scripts to make
# them work:
#
# Added function CATCHEXEC that does the same thing as catch "exec ..."
# but also displays each command and the response as well as any error codes
# that are returned from the exec.
#
# Added a loop in is_butc_ready to wait up to 200 seconds for the butc
# process to start, sleeping 10 seconds between checks.
#
# Changed the expected command output to match the messages generated
# by the current version of the code.
#
# Added sleeps around some of the tape I/O commands to keep them from
# failing because the device wasn't ready.
#
# Added chmod ogu+rwx commands after each fts crmount to give the test
# scripts access to the test filesets
#
#
# [from r1.3 by delta hyer-7109-backup-test-changes, r1.1]
#
# Revision 1.4  1995/11/29  17:13:56  hyer
# Delta for changes made to the backup scripts to get the backup tests running.
# Several changes were made to get the tests to run:
#
# 1. A loop was added to is_butc_ready to retry the status command
#    every 10 seconds, and time out after 200 seconds. The tests were
#    not being run because it can take over 1 minute for butc to start.
#
# 2. The directory permissions needed to be changed to allow R/W access
#    on the test filesets after they were created with fts crmount.
#
# 3. The error checking code in restore_disk and restore_ft, and dump
#    was reworked to make sure that the success or failure of the
#    operation was detected during the test.
#
# 4. The calls to "fts dump" and "fts restore" were returing error status
#    even though the operation succeeded. Changed the script to read the
#    response from the command to decide whether or not the command worked.
#
# 5. Added a EXEC routine that calls exec, but prints out each command and
#    the response.
#
# 6. Several other minor changes were made to address verious problems
#    with how the scripts were checking the success or failure of the
#    tests. The tests have run successfully start to finish on
#    Solaris with the changes reflected in this delta.
#
# see above
# [from r1.3 by delta hyer_7109_fixes_to_backup_test_scripts, r1.1]
#
# Revision 1.3  1993/12/01  19:47:43  vijay
# Two places in the TEST_PRE where pass was unset instead of run
# [from r1.2 by delta vijay-db4692-bak-add-restoreft-tests-to-suite, r1.3]
#
# Revision 1.2  1993/11/29  22:03:18  vijay
# change "pass " to "pass". The trailing space seems to be sensitive.
# [from r1.1 by delta vijay-db4692-bak-add-restoreft-tests-to-suite, r1.2]
#
# Revision 1.1  1993/11/15  23:00:33  vijay
# Add the test suite for the bak restoreft command to the test harness.
# [added by delta vijay-db4692-bak-add-restoreft-tests-to-suite, r1.1]
