                     Message-Oriented Services (MOS)
		     -------------------------------
								November 1996


This is the first snapshot of a prototype for Message-Oriented Services
(MOS) for OSF DCE.  It provides a message queuing capability for DCE.
(We left the name more general than just queuing so we can evolve to also
handle message passing.)

The MOS is a DCE-based message queuing service, where clients enqueue and
dequeue messages via DCE RPC.  Queues are protected by DCE ACLs, thus
offering protection from unauthorized access.  Since communication is done
through DCE RPC, clients can take advantage of RPC security features.

This release is in the "nosupport" tree of DCE release 1.2.2.  We intend
to continue work on this with an as-yet unknown level of effort, and it will
be available off the DCE web site, http://www.opengroup.org/dce/.

Contents of this release include:

    README		this file
    License		licensing terms
    Install		installation instructions
    doc			directory of various documentation
    src			source code and IDL files

The src subtree contains:
    idl			IDL definitions
    api			API, as libmos.a
    qmgr		queue manager
    moscp		MOS control program (TCL-based, dcecp-like)
    tcl_dce		TCL code for moscp
    test		test apps:
	basic		quick, basic test that enqueues and dequeues messages
	telcom		a more involved example with a multiple queue clients
	qif		a primitive management interface that talks to a qmgr

The doc subtree contains:
    specs		rfc99 (draft), API spec
    webpages		various design documents we had on our web site

The source

The MOS is intended to reside *on top of* a DCE 1.1 (or later).  We have
purposely developed it on top of a commercial DCE so it could be used by
anyone, not just source licensees.  It was developed on HP-UX 10.10 with
their DCE product (their version 1.4?)

The Makefile are written for vanilla make.  They also work with gnumake.
They are not compliant with ODE make.  There are HP-isms (just compiler
directives) which must be adjusted to build on other platforms.

We are well-aware that this is not complete.  There are missing features
which we hope to get to.
