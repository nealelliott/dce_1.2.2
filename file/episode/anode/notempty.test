# 	Transarc delta: mason-ot2930-logbuf-parts-of-nbs 1.14
# 	  Selected comments:
# 	    This is the logbuf portion of new block security (making sure someone
# 	    else's data does not appear in your file across a system crash.)  For
# 	    details, see the OT report, the postings to transarc.afs.episode, and
# 	    the white paper on this subject.  Not done yet.  SNAPSHOT ONLY.
# 	    Just wanted to fix a small nit in test_res.
# 	    More work on NBS.  This is only a snapshot.
# 	    Another snapshot; this time we make the interfaces between anode & buffer
# 	    uniform (each was using a different convention).  Clean up names at the same
# 	    time.  SNAPSHOT ONLY.
# 	    Another snapshot.  NBS now works in the forward direction for basic.test!
# 	    This part of this delta was removed and added to delta
# 	    mason-ot5070-gc-tran-in-logfull-avoidance
# 	    Snapshot of code working in the forward path in mp.test.
# 	    Removed the contents of revision 1.6
# 	    Checkpoint.  No work done here, just made sure that the other new
# 	    delta works OK (mason-ot5070-gc-tran-in-logfull-avoidance).
# 	    Make all_tests work again.
# 	    Increase log size.
# 	    Finish making all the tests run now.
# 	    Cleanup compilation on OSF/1.
# 	    Continue work to get new block security going.
# 	    Add a script for the nbs tests.
