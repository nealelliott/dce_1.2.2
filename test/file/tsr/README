This directory contains two sets of tests.  The first set uses the
tsrtest program and is designed for token state recovery hand testing.
These tests are general purpose and their operation is described in
TSR-README.

The second set of tests is for automated testing of token state
recovery on fileset move.  The program is called movetsrtest.  It
is a shell script that needs to read 2 other scripts: utils and
remotelock.  If these files are not in the current directory, TESTTOP
must point to the directory containing the file.   The trylock
executable must be in the same directory.  The results of the tests
are written to a file in the current directory: tsrtest.MMDDYY[.uniq].  

These tests must be run as root (-localauth is used).  In addition,
the ability to create DFS mount points under /.:/fs is required.  The 
test machine must have at least one LFS aggregate and must be a member
of a cell with at least one other machine.  That machine must have an
LFS aggregate.  Remote machines and aggregates are chosen
automatically -- no test configuration is necessary. 

The test suite consists of 3 testcases:

	open a file, move fileset, read file
		Make sure fileset has moved and that it is still
		accessible.

	open file, write file, move fileset, write again, read remotely
		Makes sure that the write token is revoked on fileset
		move and that it is properly reobtained.

	open a file, lock it, move fileset, try to lock remotely
		Makes sure the lock token is reobtained.
