These tests need to source a utilities file.  If this file (utils) is
not in the current directory, the environment variable TESTTOP must
point to the directory containing the file.  The results of the tests
are written to a file in the current directory: zlctest.MMDDYY[.uniq].

These tests must be run as root (-localauth is used).  In addition,
the ability to create DFS mount points under /.:/fs is required.  The
test machine must have at least 2 LFS aggregates and at least one
other machine in the cell with at least one LFS aggregate.  These
aggregates and the remote host will be chosen automatically -- no test
configuration is necessary. 

The test suite consists of 6 testcases:

	delete an LFS file
	delete a DFS file
	local create, open dfs, delete local, read dfs
	dfs create, local open, dfs delete, local read
	read of zlc across local fileset move
	read of zlc across remote fileset move

The final test has an additional test that is turned on by setting the
REMOTECHECK environment variable before running the test suite.  The
problem is that when the fileset is moved to a remote machine, the ZLC
manager on the remote starts to request an open-for-delete (OFD)
token.  When it does this, it realizes that the fileset is in transit,
so it holds the request and sets the time to queue the request from
the move timeout value (8-10 minutes).  The impact on the test is
that, since the OFD is not requested until the tiemout expires, the
disk space will not be immediately reclaimed when its last reference
goes away.  If REMOTECHECK is set, the testcase will wait for 10 1/2
minutes -- time enough for the timeout to expire and the token to be
granted -- and check that the storage has been returned.  This is
"optional" because of the extra 10 minutes required.

More information is available in "Zero-Linkcount File Manager Test
Plan".
