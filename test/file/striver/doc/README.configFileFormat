Main Test Driver config file:

A record is used to describe each type of object to be handled by
driver.  The record contains fields that describe various attributes
of the object.  An OPTIONAL attribute is described in the record
format by being enclosed in square parenthesis. All other attributes
are REQUIRED and not specifying such an attribute will cause error
Default values will be assumed for some optional attributes. Any such default values are mentioned below.

The format used in describing an attribute is given below. The meaning
of each field on the RHS should be obvious from the context.

Attribute Name      Attribute description
                    [ Attribute format ]
                    Special and default values 
                    [ Examples ]
                    Other special information

Whenever a size needs to be specified, the unit is a singular object.
If a K is tagged on at the end, multiply number by 1024 and for a M
suffix, multiply by 1024*1024.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AGGREGATES:

Currently the UFS partitions are expected to be formatted. LFS
partitions will be reformatted.

Format:

SECTION AGGR 

    [ NOINIT ]

    AGGRTYPE
    CELLNAME
    [ MACHINE ]
    DEVNAME
    [ DEVSIZE ]
    [ AGGRNAME ]
    AGGRID

    # for LFS aggregates
    [ BLKSIZE ]
    [ FRAGSIZE ]

    # for UFS partitions under DFS
    [ FSETNAME ]

Flags:

[ NOINIT ]      Do not initialize aggregate
                Default     Initialize the aggregate.

Attribute values:

AGGRTYPE        Type of aggregate
                UFS          UFS Aggregate
                LFS          LFS Aggregate

CELLNAME        Cellname without /...
                noExport    For standalone aggregate
                Default     Local cell (localCell)

[ MACHINE   ]   Machine on which aggregate resides
                Default     Local machine (localHost)

DEVNAME         Device name 
                absolute e.g. /dev/xxxx> or relative to /dev

[ DEVSIZE  ]    Device size in bytes.

[ AGGRNAME ]    Aggregate name. 
                The aggregate  name  of a non-LFS partition must match
                the name of the partition's local mount point (for
                example, /usr).
                Default     The last component of the absolute device pathname
                These have to be UNIQUE in each machine in each cell.
                Optimization: If aggregate names are unique in each
                cell, then the MACHNAME attribute can be omitted in a
                FSET record. If aggregate names are unique across
                all cells then both CELLNAME and MACHNAME attributes
                can be ommitted from the FSET record.
        
                Currently aggregate names are assumed to be unique across
                all machines, all cells, i.e. code does NOT IMPLEMENT necessary
                support for non-unique aggregate names.

                the fileset number. %d NOT IMPLEMENTED.

[ FSETQUOTA ]   Fileset quota in bytes.
                Default     5M
