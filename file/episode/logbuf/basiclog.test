# 	Transarc delta: mason-ot5976-defer-io-during-recovery 1.2
# 	  Selected comments:
# 	    The NBS changes meant that there could be many pages which didn't really need
# 	    I/O.  The existing simplistic algorithm was merrily reading and writing those
# 	    pages even though no data on the pages was modified.  To fix this, we merely
# 	    defer the I/O until we find a transaction really needing to write on the data
# 	    page; once found we keep it around.  At the end we check to see if we ever
# 	    read it.  If so, we write it back to disk. If not, we just go to the next
# 	    modified disk block.
# 	    This first delta is a checkpoint.
# 	    Complete work here.  This version completes the delta.  Add several
# 	    regression tests and enhance the testing language to support better
# 	    concurrency guarantees.
# 	    Changed test language, changed usage.

# 	Transarc delta: mason-ot3721-start-tran-not-required 1.6
# 	  Selected comments:
# 	    When a transaction has an end record, it should always be redone; I'm
# 	    sure I've previously made this fix (long, long ago in a world far, far
# 	    away).  This requires changing MarkCommitted in recovery and getting the
# 	    regression test suite built again.  This is a CHECKPOINT only.
# 	    Get right version of this test from RCS archives.  Make it work.
# 	    Checkpoint first system which shows signs of really working.
# 	    This checkpoint notes the first place where the regression test suite
# 	    works again.  Additional work is required to verify that the original
# 	    bug (as found by OTA) is really gone.
# 	    This is another checkpoint.  I'm working on building the regression test.
# 	    Make changes in readlog so it is easier to use.
# 	    Oops.  Calling wrong log record printer. [tony, not ted]
# 	Transarc delta: mason-tran-0033 1.11
# 	  Selected comments:
# 	    Checkpoint for the year-end.
# 	    Changes made earlier were lost - I carried them forward.
# 	    Intermediate snapshot - single threaded code now working correctly.
# 	    SHOULD NOT BE USED IN PRODUCTION.
# 	    Moved lost changes from backup volume into main tree.
# 	    Forced close to fix a different problem. This delta still does not work; do
# 	    not use in production!
# 	    Snapshot - passes all_tests.
# 	    More work - now fixing bugs.
# 	    Final round of testing; appears to be production quality now.
# 	    Update internal development records.
# 	    Found single-threaded case in TranForce which would block.
# 	    Macro removed in delta 1.9 was used in multiple files.
# 	    Found race condition where tran was referenced before initialization.
