# HISTORY
# $TALog: savedb-1.2b,v $
# Revision 1.3  1996/01/21  09:48:44  hyer
# Changes to make the backup test scripts with the callout routines for
# mount and unmount in DCE 1.2.
#
# Added cm checkfilesets and cleaned up test to run with callout routines
# [from r1.2 by delta hyer-7265-backup-test-mods-for-callout-routines, r1.1]
#
# Revision 1.2  1994/01/10  18:27:40  davecarr
# Upgraded tests to work with expect-5.1.3.  Also moved some configuration
# dependencies from savedb-cmd to generic.exp.  In the process, some
# variables had "sa_" prepended to them to indicate that they are used only
# for the savedb tests.

#    This is the first pass at automating tests for the bak savedb command.
# They work with expect-4.3.  They will need to be updated to work with
# expect, version 5.

# Initial checkin.  Test works with expect-4.3.
