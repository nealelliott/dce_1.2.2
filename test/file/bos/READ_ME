CAVEATS
-------
1) Read the Setup section closely.
2) Read the Setup section closely.
3) The machine running the tests must be a DFS server or have a DFS
	server principal.
4) After any interruption, do a 'bos stat' to make sure that there is
no garbage left in the BosConfig file.

Setup
-----
If these tests are to be run on a single machine, the tests can be run
from anywhere.  (Note that if the tests are being run out of AFS, the
bosserver MUST HAVE TOKENS.)  If doing multiple machine testing,
however, special actions must be taken:


	1) Testing BOS-managed processes.  Some of the tests in the
	test suite attempt to create a bos-managed process by using
	the path of the executable from the local machine, not the
	remote.  The best way around this problem is to copy the bos
	subtree and the util subtree under the same local directory on
	each machine, e.g. /usr/tmp/testdir/{bos,util}.

	2) RCP/RSH.  Some of the tests need to remotely execute
	commands or to copy files back and forth.  They use rcp and
	rsh to do this.  This means that you should set up the
	machines to allow these commands to work (including .rhosts
	files and daemons).

	3) Selecting a remote machine.  A remote machine is selected
	by setting and exporting the SERVER_1 environment variable.
	E.g.: 
		setenv SERVER_1 power8
	By default, this gets set to the local host name.

The following setup is required for all tests:

	1) Hostname.  The value returned by "hostname" should be the
	same as that you would specify as the last part of the DCE
	name.  I.e., if the DCE name is /.:/hosts/power8, hostname
	must return 'power8', not 'power8.transarc.com'.  The hostname
	command can be used to change this ("hostname power8").

	2) Needed directories.  Both the "bos" and the "util"
	directories must be present.

	3) Identities.  You must run these tests as root and klogged
	as cell_admin.

	4) TESTTOP.  This variable must be exported and must contain
	the name of the directory containing "bos" and "util".  E.g. 
		setenv TESTTOP /usr/tmp/testdir

	5) File permissions.  Make sure that bos/runtests and
	bos/tests/test* have execute permissions.  If necessary, 
		[In bos]$ chmod +x runtests tests/test*

Running the tests:
------------------
Congratulations!  You're ready to run the tests.  The tests are run
with the 'runtests' command, which takes no arguments.  The results
come both to the screen and to the a file called 'bos.runtests.log'.
Subsequent runs will be appended.

If individual tests need to be run, they can be run directly (e.g.
tests/test4).  test0 is not normally run as part of the test suite.
What it tests is covered more completely by the rest of the suite.  If
you chose to run it, it requires the '-admin' switch.

The tests take approximately 30 minutes to run on a single RS/6000; a
bit longer on a PMAX.  Tests 4 and 10 tend to take the longest.  Also,
don't worry if test7 is not run; there is no test7.
