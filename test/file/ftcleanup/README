		FILESET CLEANUP TESTS

Version 1.0
-----------

This file gives some details about the fileset cleanup tests and explains
how to run them.

The cleanup test driver is the file called runtests.  It is a script that
takes a few options on the command line and acts accordingly.  It runs tests
1 through 5 which test various cleanup features.  The runtests script
has simple help facilities for the command line options.  For example:

	$ runtests -help
	Usage: runtests [-nt <iter>] [-np <procs>] [-server1 <host>]
	[-server2 <host>] [-help]

nt is the number of iterations running tests 1 through 5.  np is the number of
processes running the ftcleanup tests (1 through 4) simultaneously, server1 is the
name of the first server machine (eg. paradox), and server2 is the name of the
second server machine.

All tests currently require two distinct file server machines.  All file
server machines must be running the DFS file server exporting at least one
DCE LFS (Episode) aggregate, and they must also be running the DFS fileset
server.

These tests will, by default, auto-configure to a certain extent, examining
the membership of the subsys/dce/dfs-admin group to locate one or two DFS file
server machines and executing the ``fts aggrinfo'' command to locate one or
two DCE LFS aggregates on those file server machines.  The auto-configuration
choice of servers may be overridden by providing arguments on the ``runtests''
command line.  Alternatively, the auto-configuration choice of servers and/or
aggregates may be overridden by the use of environment variables SERVER_1,
SERVER_2, SERV1_AGGR1, SERV2_AGGR2, and SERV1_AGGR3.  When setting
these variables, remember that SERVER_1 must export DCE LFS aggregates
SERV1_AGGR1 and SERV1_AGGR3, and SERVER_2 must export DCE LFS aggregate
SERV2_AGGR2.

The runtests driver can be invoked from any directory.  That is, PWD need not
be within DFS, so you don't have to copy the tests into DFS space.  Typically,
the test scripts are stored somewhere in the source hierarchy, and you could
invoke runtests directly from here.  A log is maintained in PWD (the directory
from which the tests were invoked).  This can be overridden by setting the
environment variable MOV_LOG_HOME to a particular directory (eg. /tmp).  The
log file is created in the directory indicated by MOV_LOG_HOME.  The default
is the directory from which the runtests driver was invoked.  The log contains
details about the PASS/FAIL status of each test(1 through 16).  There would
also be messages about which test failed indicating by an error number
(eg. E87).  Looking for this error code in the test script would show which
particular command failed.  Alternatively, the MOV_VERBOSE environment
variable can be set to "ON", and this causes the shell script to execute in
verbose mode, dumping each script line into the log file.

The tests can be run with server1 and server2 being either RS/6000 (AIX) or
DS 3100/2100 (OSF/1).

Details on the tests:
  mtest1: multi-case driver for mtestsub1
  mtestsub1: tests whether an interrupted move produces the expected state, and
	tests what happens after filesets are no longer busy
  mtest2: multi-case driver for mtestsub2
  mtestsub2: tests whether post-move cleanups occur
  mtest3: tests whether repeating an ``fts move'' command can complete an
	earlier, interrupted, ``fts move'' command.
  mtest4: multi-case driver for mtestsub4
  mtestsub4: same as mtestsub1, but does intra-server moves
  mtest5: same as mtest3, but does intra-server moves

Each test (other than the test drivers) will accept, in the environment
variable CASES, a set of test cases to be run, often simultaneously.  If CASES
is not provided, a default value will be provided.
