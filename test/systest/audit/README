Note: These tests assume that the auditing functionality can be built
      installed and the audit daemon can be started successfully.

Test Name: AUDSTR001

	- Test many users logging in simultaneously
	  Procedure:
	   - Start auditd
	   - Add AUDIT_ACCTS DCE users to the registry
	   - Fork off AUDIT_ACCTS processes
	   - AUDIT_ACCTS processes wait on a shared variable
	   - When shared variable reaches AUDIT_ACCTS all process login simultaneously
	   - manually verify there are audit log entries
	   - Stop auditd

	   Note: AUDIT_ACCTS is an integer configuration variable read in 
	      from the tetexec.cfg file.  The default value is 5.


Test Name: AUDREL001


	- Have client(s) sending events to the same log
	   Procedure:

	   This test will make use of an application
	   which will have the following defineable parameters

	   AUDIT_DURATION	"How long to run the test"	(minutes)
	   AUDIT_EVENT_DELAY	"Period for issuing events"	(seconds)
	   AUDIT_NUM_OF_CLIENTS    "Number of clients to run"	(whole number)

	   AUDIT_DURATION will have the default 60 minutes and
	   AUDIT_EVENT_DELAY will have the default 5 seconds
	   AUDIT_NUM_OF_CLIENTS will have the default 1

	    - Start the auditd using auditcp
	    - Start AUDIT_NUM_OF_CLIENTS 
	    - Emit an event every AUDIT_EVENT_DELAY from each of the 1 clients
	    - Use auditcp to verify that there are 
	      1*[60*AUDIT_DURATION] / AUDIT_EVENT_DELAY events which are logged

	     Note: Currently only a single client is supported for this test.
		   Values of AUDIT_NUM_OF_CLIENTS other than 1 are ignored.

Installing the Tests
- ---------------------

Run dcetest_config and choose option 9 Audit 
off the DCE Test Installation (System Tests) Menu


Running the Tests
- -----------------

Note: The audit tests assume you have the audit daemon configured
      and running on your node

To run the tests without the use of  run scripts, do the following:

su to root

Set the environment variable TET_ROOT to /dcetest/dcelocal/test/tet

Change directory to $TET_ROOT/bin

To run the audstr001 test:

./tcc -e system/audit audstr001

To run the audrel001 test (must dce_login as cell_admin first):

dce_login cell_admin -dce-

./tcc -e system/audit audrel001

To run both tests:

./tcc -e system/audit all


To run the tests with the run scripts do the following:

Set the environment variable TET_ROOT to /dcetest/dcelocal/test/tet

$ cd/dcetest/dcelocal/test/tet/system
$ . profile.dcest.tet
$ run.aud -l 1 audrel001

      or
$ run.aud -l audstr001

Note: If you run the audrel001 test repeatedly and are getting
      "Unknown signal 20" errors in your TET journal.
      Add the following line to the beginning of your tetexec.cfg file.
      The file is /dcetest/dcelocal/test/tet/system/audit/tetexec.cfg

	TET_SIG_IGN=20


Examining the results
- ---------------------


Check the TET journal file for results

If the tests succeed, the string "PASS" will be entered into the TET journal.

The tests could fail because of any of the following reasons:

-Could not clear audit databases
-Could not start audit daemon
-Could not make registry entries
-Could not login to DCE accounts
-Could not issue events to the audit trail
-Could not use auditcp to examine audit trail

If the tests fail, the string "FAIL" will be entered into the TET journal.
