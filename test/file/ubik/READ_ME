A later revision has added a new test driver for the utst_ tests.

New driver:
==========
The utst_driver script can be used instead of the other scripts to
driver to drive the utst_{client,server} testing.  Unlike the other
scripts, utst_driver can be run on any machine.  It makes use of the
bosserver to do the initial configuration and to run the utst_server
part of the test.  The basic procedure is:

$ dce_login cell_admin
$ utst_driver -init <args>
<args> is a list of machines you want to run the tests on.  If no
machines are specified, all the machines in the cell are used.

$ utst_driver -stat [ <host list> ]
This will give you udebug status information.  Wait until quorum is
achieved. 

$ utst_driver [-trunc | -inc | -qget | -get | -mget ]
Run desired tests (from any machine)

$ utst_driver -shutdown
Clean up afterwards.

More help is available with the -help and -info options.

Prerequisites:
You need to run init and shutdown as cell_admin.  
Binaries for utst_server must be installed in /opt/dcelocal/bin on
each machine.  Binaries for utst_client must be in the search path.
