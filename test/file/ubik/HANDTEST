Instructions for configuring the ubik utst_ tests by hand:
==========================================================

1) Add the utst group entry in the namespace:

	# rpccp add entry /.:/subsys/dce/dfs/utst

	>>> entry added

	# rpccp export -o `uuidgen` /.:/subsys/dce/dfs/utst

	>>> objects exported

2) Add each server which will run the utst_server into the
   group:

	# rpccp add member -m /.:/hosts/<hostname>/self /.:/subsys/dce/dfs/utst

	>>> group member added

3) Add the security group for utst into the registry and add each host running
   the utst_server into the group:

	# rgy_edit 
	Current site is: registry server at /.../ds/subsys/dce/sec/master 
	rgy_edit=> do g
	Domain changed to: group
	rgy_edit=> add subsys/dce/dfs-utst-servers
	rgy_edit=> member subsys/dce/dfs-utst-servers -a hosts/<hostname>/dfs-server
	rgy_edit=> quit
	bye.

4) Set up admin.utst identical to admin.fl on all machines running utst_server.

5) Start the utst_server on each machine:

	# utst_server -nsgroup /.:/subsys/dce/dfs/utst &

6) To run the utst_client, issue:

	# utst_client -nsgroup /.:/subsys/dce/dfs/utst -mget

        Other options to utst_client are:

          -trunc  to set the number to zero
          -inc    to increment the stored number
          -qget   to get the number from any server
          -get    to get the number from the sync site
	  -mget   to do get, inc, get, get, sleep 1 (repeatedly until ^C)
	  -minc   to do get, inc, get, inc, sleep 1 (repeatedly until ^C)
	  -incf   to do inc, sleep 1 (repeatedly until ^C)

	These last 3 are stress tests.

7) To see current ubik status, issue the following command on each
   utst_server machine:

	# udebug /.:/subsys/dce/dfs/utst -long
