##  NAME:

##      rpc.sams
##
##  FACILITY:
##
##      Remote Procedure Call
##
##  ABSTRACT:
##
##  This file defines the messages used by the RPC facility.  It
##  uses DCE "SAMS" format.
##
##  NOTE WELL:  New messages must be added ONLY AT THE END of this file to
##  ensure that binary compatibility is maintained.  (We cannot allow each
##  version of the RPC library having different meanings for each integer
##  status code.)  Symbols for errors that are no longer used, must still 
##  be maintained here, until a coordinated built of all product components,
##  i.e. the next version.
