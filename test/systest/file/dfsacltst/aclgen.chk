			DFS ACL Generator Checklist
			---------------------------

	ACL Generation Phase
	---------------------
	There are 9 different types of acl entries that could be applied to 
	an object and for each one of the 9 different types of acl entries
	there are 6 different permissions that could be either granted or
	denied.	 This leads to a combinatorial explosion of the different
	set of acls that could be applied to any given object.	We need
	to intelligently generate (either manually or automatically) a
	subset of the set of acls that would be sufficient for our purposes.
	The program to generate a full (or a subset) set of acls is the
	ACL_GENERATOR.	
        The input for the ACL_GENERATOR is a file containing
	a list of objects and the type of the object. (one on each line)
	The output of the ACL_GENERATOR is a series of files each containing a 
	set of acls for an object.  The output files will be named as:
		objectname_xxxxx.aclset
	where 'xxxxx' is a sequentially generated number.

	Each file will consists of one or more lines. Each line consists of
	several fields delimited by ':'
		aclentrytype:permission_set
		(Note: acl entry key is not specified as it will be generated
		       later).
		where:
			aclentrytype is one of:
				user_obj
				user
				foreign_user
				group_obj
				group
				foreign_group
				other_obj
				foreign_other
				any_other
			permission_set is a combination of:
				r, w, x, c, i and d.
	
	Processing Logic: TBD

	Reference Document: DCE Administration Guide Volume 2
				Module 6 - Chapter 3 


	NOTE: In addition to setting up the aclset files, the systems involved
	      in the test should have their root account accessible from
	      the root account of the system where the main test driver would
	      be started from. (i.e the '.rhosts' files should be set up in
              each of these system's root account to permit access from the
              main test system)
