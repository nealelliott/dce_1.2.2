*
*  doLocalMoveTest - if non-zero, then the local move test is run, i.e.
*		     the fileset is moved from one aggregate on the local
*		     machine to another on the same machine.
*  aggregateDevice1 - name of first local aggregate.  For the local fileset
* 		      move, the fileset moved here to aggregateDevice2
*  aggregateDevice2 - name of second local aggregate. 
*  doRemoteMoveTest - if non-zero, then the remote move test is run, i.e.
*		     the fileset is moved from one aggregate on the local
*		     machine to another on a different machine.
*  remoteAggregateDevice - name of the remote aggregate.
*  remoteHostName - name of the remote host where fileset will be moved to.
*  moveTimeout - the time the clients will wait for the fileset move
*		 to take place.  Its value is in seconds.
*  numFiles - the number of files to open on the fileset.
*  showVerboseFts - non-zero to show the output of the fts commands
*  totalFilesetKB - the total size to which the moving fileset should be grown
*		in 1K blocks (or zero not to grow it)
