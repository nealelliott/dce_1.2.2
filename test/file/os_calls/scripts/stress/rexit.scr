* USAGE: ./file_test -l /.:/dfs_test/a    (for hub)
*        ./file_test -c /.:/dfs_test/a    (for two spokes)
*

*
* rexit.scr.
*  
* This script should be called when executing auto-spoke with logfile
* options. Since in that case rsh will not exit until the Hub requests
* the spoke to exit by itl command "rexit".

  rexit $ITL_spoke[$x]
endloop
