#	This file ('testname.setup') should exist for each 'testname.aclset'
#	file and should do the following three steps:
#	
#	  1. Create the object in the local cell (you can use the environment
#	     variable CELL_LOCAL for this. It would exist when this script is
#            run.
#
#	  2. Set the unix mode bits for the object and all the objects leading
#            to it as you desire.
#
#	  3. Execute the command:
#		chown uo_user $OBJECTNAME
#                (to set the ownership of the object to 'uo_user')
#
#	  3. Execute the command:
#		acl_edit -f 'testname.aclsetup' 'fully_qualified_objectname'
#
#	      ('testname.aclsetup' will exist when this file is run).
#
#
#	This file will be executed by 'acldriver.ksh'
