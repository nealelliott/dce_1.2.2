Subject: Using Kerberos 5 beta 6 with AFS and/or DCE/DFS
X-UIDL: 37fb0d7fab2cad6490f5076bc1f2ca97
Status: RO


Kerberos 5 beta 6 can be combined with OSF/DCE by using the DCE
security server as the KDC. This allows for single sign on using the
DCE userid and password. You can thus get the best features of both:
DCE applications such as DFS; kerberized clients such as rlogin, 
telnet or FTP. These kerberized clients can be run on machines with or
without DCE, and can be used to establish encrypted terminal
sessions. This is very useful when the cell admin needs to login to a
server to do system maintenance work without exposing his password or the
root password. DCE 1.2.2 is expected to have some of this capability,
builtin. But if you need it now, it is available. 
 
Kerberos 5 also has the ability to forward tickets during an rlogin
connection for example. These forwarded tickets can be used to
establish a DCE context. Thus you can be on a non DCE client,
establish a connection to a DCE client and get you DCE context.
Very useful for DFS access. We have developed modifications which will
do this automaticly during the remote login.  

AFS is probably the most wide spread Kerberos 4 application in
production. We have also developed modifications which will allow you
to get a Kerberos 5 ticket from the DCE security server and/or K5 KDC 
and convert it to a AFS token. This do can be done automaticly during
login as well. Note that this AFS modification does not rely on DCE,
and can be used in a Kerberos only environment. But if you have DCE,
it can also be used to get an AFS token from your DCE context. Thus
both of these modifications can be combined, and get both a DCE context
and/or a AFS token from a forwarded ticket. It also works with the
Transarc AFS/DFS migration package too.  


Kerberos 5 beta 6 was released from MIT on 6/6/96, and is much
improved over the Kerberos 5 beta 5. MIT have been very responsive to
our needs and has included in this release many of the features which
allow it to inter-operate with DCE.  This release can be built directly
without any modifications to the source and use a DCE security server
as the KDC. See their documentation and man pages.  This can then be
combined with DCE to address the problem of clear-text password over
the network.

But, the changes to get a DCE context and/or a AFS token from a
forwarded ticket are not included in Kerberos 5 beta 6. Over the past
few years, many of us in the DOE ESnet community (and others) have been
active in the Kerberos DCE integration effort. In addition to
cross-realm authentication, we have been active in the use of the
forwarded ticket to get a DCE context and/or an AFS token.



A complete set of changes for these modifications can be found at:
ftp://achilles.ctd.anl.gov/pub/kerberos.v5.

The README, explains what is at the FTP site.

Two other files: afs524.notes and anldce.notes contain comments about
the two main set of changes: AFS tokens, and DCE interactions
including changing your DCE password using the unmodified K5b6 kpasswd.

If you have visited this ftp site before you will note the
modifications to previous versions of Kerberos have been moved to the
"old" directory. Every thing you need to get started is in the
pub/kerberos.v5 directory accept the base MIT Kerberos 5 beta 6 code. You
must get that from MIT at ftp://athena-dist.mit.edu.

Basically there is diff file with all the changes, k56.cdiff.960709,
which can be applied with patch to the MIT base.  

The aklog program (now called /krb5/sbin/ak5log) is in
ak5log.960708.tar along with the k5afslogin program. Previously you
need to get both the tar file and a diff file. 

The k5dce.960708.tar contains the k5dcelogin program. This was
redesigned to match the specifications as defined in OSF RFC 92.0, so
it can be easily replaced in the future. 

A special note is needed for those using the AIX 4.1.4 system. As
shipped from IBM, the libdce.a does not have all the external symbols
exported for use as a shared library. IBM negatively responded to our
suggestion that these additional entry points be exported. To "fix"
the problem, there is a fix.aix.libdce.mk makefile included with the
k5dce source.

Transarc on the other hand, responded positively when asked how to
determine the obfuscated names of these same entry points in their
products. There were no problems with the HP code either, as these entry
points were already exported.   

I have built this in AIX 4.1.4, HPUX 10.10, Solaris 2.4, SunOS 4.1.3,
SGI 5.3 and Windows 3.1. And have used HPUX, Transarc 1.0.3a, and
Transarc 1.1 DCE security servers as the KDCs.

Subject: Kerberos 5 beta 7 and DCE 1.1 Cross Cell Authentication
X-UIDL: b7874609eb16340e049d93c5af05e3b9
Status: RO


This afternoon I got cross-cell authentication to work (both ways)
between a DCE 1.1 cell and a Kerberos 5 beta 7 cell. I know that LANL
and NASA are both trying to do this. This note describes that its
possible to do, rather then this is the best way to do it.

The DCE cell (dce.anl.gov) is running on HPUX 10.10 security servers,
and the K5 beta 7 cell (k5.test.anl.gov) is running on Solaris 2.5.

To do this requires that the DCE registry have a principal for
   krbtgt/k5.test.anl.gov
and the K5 database have principals
   krbtgt/k5.test.anl.gov@dce.anl.gov and
   krbtgt/dce.anl.gov@k5.test.anl.gov.
These must all have the same KEY and kvno, and the enctype in K5 must
be the des-cbc-crc. 

Before starting this exercise, I setup the K5 krb5.conf and kdc.conf
files to use the most (DCE) compatible options possible. I want to go
back and try and improve the K5 only security at a later time. This
may require sumbitting a change to MIT, since some of the libdefaults
should apply by realm.  

This included in the krb5.conf file setting:
  default_tkt_enctypes = des-cbc-crc
  default_tgs_enctypes = des-cbc-crc
  kdc_req_checksum_type = 2

 and in the kdc.conf:  
  supported_enctypes = des-cbc-crc:normal des:v4

On the DCE side, using rgy_edit (or dcecp) add the principal and
account for krbtgt/k5.test.anl.gov with any password. This will have
kvno 1.

Then run the cpwkey.c program with these options:
 ./cpwkey -u krbtgt/k5.test.anl.gov -p -P "" -v 2
This will prompt for a password, and the cell_admin password.
Remember this password. The -P "" says set a null pepper, and -v 2 is
for kvno 2.

After creating the K5 data base, run:

 /krb5/sbin/kadmin.local -e des-cbc-crc:v4

 kadmin.local:  addprinc krbtgt/dce.anl.gov
 Enter password for principal "krbtgt/dce.anl.gov@k5.test.anl.gov":<any one>
 Re-enter password for principal "krbtgt/dce.anl.gov@k5.test.anl.gov":
 Principal "krbtgt/dce.anl.gov@k5.test.anl.gov" created.

 kadmin.local:  cpw krbtgt/dce.anl.gov
 Enter password for principal "krbtgt/dce.anl.gov": <match the cpwkey one>
 Re-enter password for principal "krbtgt/dce.anl.gov":
 Password for "krbtgt/dce.anl.gov@k5.test.anl.gov" changed.

 kadmin.local:  getprinc krbtgt/dce.anl.gov
   ... number of other lines ... 
 Number of keys: 1
 Key: vno 2, DES cbc mode with CRC-32, Version 4
 Attributes:

 kadmin.local:  addprinc krbtgt/k5.test.anl.gov@dce.anl.gov
   ... more line similiar to above ...
 kadmin.local:  cpw krbtgt/k5.test.anl.gov@dce.anl.gov
   ... more lines similiar to above
 getprinc krbtgt/k5.test.anl.gov@dce.anl.gov
   ... more lines ...
 Number of keys: 1
 Key: vno 2, DES cbc mode with CRC-32, Version 4
 Attributes:


At this point all the keys are in place. 

A kinit in either cell followed by an rlogin to a machine in the other
cell get the cross cell tickets.

I did run into a problem with the DCE security server. If the TGT
created by the K5 kdc is not using the des-cbc-crc encryption, but
rather the des-cbc-md5, the DCE security will crash. and since the
client did not get a response, it will try the other DCE security
server, and it crashed too!  This need to be fixed. 

So cross cell is possible, but not currently straight forward. 

I had posted the cpwkey.c code previously. If anyone would like to try
this, I can send it again.

The modifications to Kerberos 5 beta 7 to allow for interoperability
with DCE and AFS including using forwarded tickets to get DCE context
and or AFS tokens; and using the v5passwd routine to change the DCE
password is now available. 

Thes modifications have undergone some testing, but they are
modifications to beta code and may have bugs as well. Use them at
you own risk.

These can be found at:

 ftp://achilles.ctd.anl.gov/pub/kerberos.v5.

See the README file. The modifications are substantially the same as
made to the Kerberos 5 beta 6 code. You may also which to look at the 
old/Announcement.k56 and old/README.k56 files as well.
