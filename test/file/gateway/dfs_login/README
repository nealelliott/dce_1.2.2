Overview:
---------
dfs_login allows users on NFS client machines to establish DCE
credentials on the NFS exporter machine in order to gain access to the
DFS.  A user needs to have a DCE account in the cell that they want to
access through the NFS mounted DFS (/.../<cell>) path.

dfs_logout will destroy the authenticated mappings created by
dfs_login.

This directory contains the dfs_login/dfs_logout command test suite that exercises 
the dfs_login/dfs_logout funtionality.

Test Setup:
-----------
export SERVER set to host exporting /... running dfsgwd
unix id and dceid must exist for tester in test4
this can be set via the variable testerowner, testergroup
but default to 12,12


Running the tests:
------------------
You must execute this test suite from the dfs_login directory. To run the tests you
issue the command "runtests".

The test suite consists of test1 - dfs_login help, test2 - dfs_logout help
test3 - dfs_login/dfs_logout functions, test4 - authenticated and unauthenticated
file access

The results are logged in the dfs_login directory file "dfs_login.runtests.log"
