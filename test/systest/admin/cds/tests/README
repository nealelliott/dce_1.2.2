	I. Overview

	The dcecp scripts DCPSAN001, DCPSAN002, DCPSAN003, found in this 
	directory, are automated dcecp scripts. They implement the steps 
	required to backup and restore the CDS name space according to the 
	procedure described in the DCE Administration Guide.

	DCPSAN001 - This script implements the procedure to backup and restore
		    the CDS namespace from a local directory.
		   
	DCPSAN002 - This script implements the procedure to back up the CDS name
                    space to a local directory.

	DCPSAN003 - This script implements the procedure to restore the CDS files
                    that were backed up by DCPSAN002.


	II. Prerequisites and Setup

	The following are prerequisites for running any of the scripts:

            o DCE 1.1 must have been installed and configured.

            o The hostmachine must be a CDS server.

            o The user running the scripts must login as root. Only
              username "root" can restart the CDS server (cdsd).


	III. Description and Mode of Operation

	Before running the tests, install and configure your test environment
	using dcetest_config (see Porting and Testing Guide) and set up your 
	test environment variables by sourcing the

            /dcetest/dcelocal/status/test/systest/profile.dcest

	file after the tests are installed by dcetest_config. After having
	sourced this file, the environment variable STROOT should be set 
	to the root directory where the tests were installed.

	Files:

               datafile_ch.tcl -  This file defines and sets the values of gobal
                                  variables.

                                  NOTE: You should review this file and change the
                                        values of any variables that do not agree
                                        with your setup, before running the test

	       procedures.tcl  -  This file contains the procedures called in
                                  DCPSAN001.


	Description:

	This script backs up and restores the CDS name space from a local directory.
	The directory which the files should be backed up to is specified by the
        variable BACKDIR.
	The directory from which to restore the files is specified by the variable
	RESTDIR.

	To run the script, simply type the name DCPSAN001 at the prompt, or source
	the file at the dcecp propmt. For example:

            $ dcecp
            dcecp> source DCPSAN001


	DCPSAN002 and DCPSAN003
	-----------------------

	Files:

                admintest_env.tcl   - This file defines and sets the values of gobal
                                      variables.
			 	   
                                      NOTE: You should review this file and change the
                                            values of any variables that do not agree 
                                            with your setup, before running the test

		cds_common_proc.tcl - This file contains the procedures called in
                                      DCPSAN002 and DCPSAN003.

	
	Description:

	DCPSAN002 implements the procedure to backup the CDS namespace to a local
	directory.

	DCPSAN003 implements the procedure to restore the CDS namespace files that
	were backed up by DCPSAN002. It restores the files from a local directory.

	To run the scripts, simply type the name at the prompt or source the file at
	the dcecp propmt. For example:

            $ dcecp
            dcecp> source DCPSAN002

	or:

            dcecp> source DCPSAN003


	The log file is called pass_fail_log and is kept in the directory:

            /dcetest/dcelocal/status/current/working/<testname>.<pid>


	IV. Clean-up

	    Run the script del_dir_objs.tcl to delete the entries created 
	    by the test scripts. This script takes as an argument the name
	    of the test that made the entries to cleanup.

	    Example of the command to run:

	    $ del_dir_objs.tcl DCPSAN002
