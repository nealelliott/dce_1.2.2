* 	Transarc delta: fred-itl-make-open-like-c 1.3
* 	  Selected comments:
* 	    Fix ITL system calls to have more C like syntax.  Previously only a
* 	    single open or opendir could be issued against a file resource, since the
* 	    filename/directory name being opened was hashed.  Now the names are no longer
* 	    hashed and the resulting file descriptor (or DIR *) is placed in a
* 	    user supplied variable.  This changes the syntax of the open, creat,
* 	    opendir and mmap commands.  They now all require a variable name as the
* 	    last argument to the command.
* 	    Also a number of commands that previously took a filename or directory
* 	    name, now take the actual file descriptor or DIR *, as was placed in a
* 	    variable by the open and opendir comands.
* 	    Make the necessary changes to the fset ("ftutil") tests to match the
* 	    described above.
* 	    Convert system calls to use the more traditional usage.
* 	    Cleanup debugging code.
* 	Transarc delta: jdp-itl-add-fset-driver 1.2
* 	  Selected comments:
* 	    Add the code for fset_test, the fileset (ftutil) test driver.
* 	    This delta adds "fset" to the list of build directories in the test tree
* 	    and adds all of the test scripts.
* 	    Clone test.
