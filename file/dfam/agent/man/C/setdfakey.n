.SH Name
.RS 5
setdfakey - Sets, changes, and deletes Master Key

.SH Syntax
.nf
.RS 5
setdfakey [{-a NetWare server name | -d NetWare server name | -l}]

.SH Description
.RS 5
The setdfakey command sets, changes, and deletes master keys. Before processing the master keys, setdfakey checks if the command is entered by a DFA administrator by comparing the actual UNIX user ID and the DFA administrators IDs stored in the master key file.  The command terminates if two IDs do not match. The master keys may not be synchronized with those of the Gateway if the keys are modified when DFA Agent is running.  Setdfakey provides an option to terminate the command if Agent is running. In the case of setting and modification, if the designated NetWare server name does not exist in the file, the server name is registered with the file after confirming with the DFA administrator. When the NetWare server name is settled, the command asks to enter a 8-byte character string twice (null characters need to set to make a 8-byte string).  If the first string and the second one do not match, re-start from the first input.  If the retry fails, setdfakey terminates with a message indicating that setting/modification of the master key is failed.  If the first string and the second one match, the string is converted to a master key, and the master key is stored to the file.

.RS -2
-l:
.RS 2
Displays the NetWare server names stored in the file.
