# 	  Selected comments:
# 	    When a transaction has an end record, it should always be redone; I'm
# 	    sure I've previously made this fix (long, long ago in a world far, far
# 	    away).  This requires changing MarkCommitted in recovery and getting the
# 	    regression test suite built again.  This is a CHECKPOINT only.
# 	    Get right version of this test from RCS archives.
# 	    Checkpoint first system which shows signs of really working.
# 	    This checkpoint notes the first place where the regression test suite
# 	    works again.  Additional work is required to verify that the original
# 	    bug (as found by OTA) is really gone.
# 	    This is another checkpoint.  I'm working on building the regression test.
# 	    Make changes in readlog so it is easier to use.
# 	    Oops.  Calling wrong log record printer. [tony, not ted]
