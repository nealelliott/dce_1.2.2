# 	  Selected comments:
# 	    This is a super-delta comprising changes necessary to accomplish both
# 	    deltas which are a very tough import and are really intertwined anyway.
# 	    Transarc delta: mason-ot5508-wrong-comparison-in-WaitForTranFree 1.4
# 	    Selected comments:
# 	    WARNING: THIS DELTA HAS HAD ITS SCOPTE MASSIVELY EXTENDED
# 	    See revision 1.2 below.
# 	    An earlier change to the transaction activity test in elbt_TranForce
# 	    resulted in an incorrect test.
# 	    This resulted in aimIII test looping in the kernel trying to commit the
# 	    transaction in a vnode being deleted.
# 	    A long chain of complications associated with the fix for this problem
# 	    gradually lead to more and more expansive repairs.  At some point the
# 	    effort devolved into a new complete rewrite of most of the functions in
# 	    the tran module and a similar fraction of the tran related functions in
# 	    the log module.  As a side-effect other OT bugs were addressed.  Here is
# 	    a list of the major changes made.
# 	    o This delta effective completes implementation of new block security.
# 	    This affects OT 3804 and OT 1020.
# 	    o Handling of ended transactions is completely revised.  Rules of
# 	    responsibility for trans in various states between tran and log
# 	    modules are clarified.  This addresses the concerns raised in OT 5249.
# 	    o The locking strategy in the tran module was extensively revised.  The
# 	    logbuf-locking document was updated.
# 	    o Changes in waiting and sleeping, especially when starting
# 	    transactions, follow from the above two changes.  Deadlocks removed
# 	    from GCTran.
# 	    o Equivalence Class handling improved, eliminating at least one latent
# 	    bug in when a pending transaction can be discarded.  Locking changes
# 	    should also improve concurrency.
# 	    o Significant enhancement of the test scripts in the stress level they
# 	    impose on the transaction system.
# 	    o Reimplemented FsyncForce to use unified buffer/event set handling.
# 	    This fixes OT 5316.
# 	    o The Quiesce operation is improved, internally to serialize, commit
# 	    metadata and commit userdata.  It still needs an interface change when
# 	    volops requirements are ready.
# 	    o Now tran and log module track three reservation sizes for
# 	    transactions: full size, undo-zero size, and end size.  This only
# 	    partially addresses the concerns of OT 4548.
# 	    o Macros for comparing log positions where improved and bullet proofed.
# 	    They now replace many suspect by-hand comparisons throughout the code.
# 	    o New test repeatedly shuts down a device when other devices with the
# 	    same block size(s) are still active.
# 	    o Added passno test to expose OT 5527.  Added to all_tests.
# 	    o Improved comments throughout.
# 	    o Added growaggr script to all_tests.  Affects OT 3216, TR 2570.
# 	    o Added vm1.test to all_tests.
# 	    o Move nbs_tests into all_tests.
# 	    o Upgraded copyrights.
# 	    After upgrading to epi 1.22 (dfs 1.53) the shutdown script stopped working.
# 	    A few more problems noticed after upgrading to epi-1.22.
# 	    A real bug in RecycleLogBufs was discovered, which resulted in reporting
# 	    a more recent value for activeLogBlock than was correct if the members
# 	    of the inTransit list were within 5 blocks of the end of the log.
# 	    A real bug in recover was discovered, which resulted in discarding the
# 	    last page of the log on the first pass (after log create).
# 	    Force tran 1 so log uses two pages.  This triggers the recovery bug.

# 	Transarc delta: mason-ot3721-start-tran-not-required 1.6
# 	  Selected comments:
# 	    When a transaction has an end record, it should always be redone; I'm
# 	    sure I've previously made this fix (long, long ago in a world far, far
# 	    away).  This requires changing MarkCommitted in recovery and getting the
# 	    regression test suite built again.  This is a CHECKPOINT only.
# 	    Checkpoint first system which shows signs of really working.
# 	    This checkpoint notes the first place where the regression test suite
# 	    works again.  Additional work is required to verify that the original
# 	    bug (as found by OTA) is really gone.
# 	    Fixed the log size to be the # of simultaneous transactions, not the
# 	    number of log blocks.
# 	    This is another checkpoint.  I'm working on building the regression test.
# 	    Added regression lines into this script.  Now seems to be OK.
# 	    Make changes in readlog so it is easier to use.
# 	    Oops.  Calling wrong log record printer. [tony, not ted]
# 	Transarc delta: mason-tran-0033 1.11
# 	  Selected comments:
# 	    Checkpoint for the year-end.
# 	    Changes made earlier were lost - I carried them forward.
# 	    Intermediate snapshot - single threaded code now working correctly.
# 	    SHOULD NOT BE USED IN PRODUCTION.
# 	    Forced close to fix a different problem. This delta still does not work; do
# 	    not use in production!
# 	    Snapshot - passes all_tests.
# 	    More work - now fixing bugs.
# 	    Final round of testing; appears to be production quality now.
# 	    Update internal development records.
# 	    Found single-threaded case in TranForce which would block.
# 	    Macro removed in delta 1.9 was used in multiple files.
# 	    Found race condition where tran was referenced before initialization.
