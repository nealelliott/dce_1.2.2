#			DCE X500 ATTRIBUTE-TYPES
# 
# This file is a database of DCE-supported X.500 attribute-types.  Some
# of these attributes are "naming attributes" (occur in the names of
# objects, as specified by the schema), but most are not.
#
# The contents and syntax of this file are as follows.
#
# The characters space|tab|newline|# are metacharacters for the syntax
# of this file.
# The character # begins a comment, which lasts until the next newline.
# Lines consisting only of comments or space|tab|newline are ignored.
# Data occurs in rows, which are divided into fields; fields are
# separated by space|tab; leading or trailing space|tab are ignored; a
# newline or comment terminates a data row.  (Also, space|tab|newline|#
# do not occur in the syntax of the fields, so there is no need to
# escape them).
# 
# OID: The ISO object identifier of the attribute-type.  It is a
# 	big-endian decimal-dot string.  Typical prefixes are:
#
#	2.5.4 = {joint-iso-ccitt(2) ds(5) attribute_type(4)}
# LABEL: The DCE naming syntax string identifier for the attribute-type.
# 	It is an alphanumeric beginning with an alpha.  In the DCE
#	Naming Syntax, it matches in a case-insensitive manner.
#
# ASN.1-IDENTIFIER: The identifier used to define the attribute-type in
# 	the relevent ISO spec (usually X.500 or X.400).  [ASN.1
# 	identifiers are alphanumerics beginning with an alpha.]
#
# SYNTAX: The ASN.1-identifier of the attribute-syntax of the
# 	attribute-type, specified in the ASN.1 definition of the
# 	attribute-type.  Currently, the following are supported:
#
#	CES:	caseExactStringSyntax ATTRIBUTE-SYNTAX
#			CHOICE {T61String, PrintableString}
#			MATCHES FOR EQUALITY SUBSTRINGS
#			::= {attributeSyntax3}
#
#	CIS:	caseIgnoreString ATTRIBUTE-SYNTAX
#			CHOICE {T61String, PrintableString}
#			MATCHES FOR EQUALITY SUBSTRINGS
#			::= {attributeSyntax 4}
#
#	PS:	printableStringSyntax ATTRIBUTE-SYNTAX
#			PrintableString
#			MATCHES FOR EQUALITY SUBSTRINGS
#			::= {attributeSyntax 5}
#
#	NS:	numericStringSyntax ATTRIBUTE-SYNTAX
#			NumericString
#			MATCHES FOR EQUALITY SUBSTRINGS
#			::= {attributeSyntax 6}
#
#	-:	unspecified
#
# Note: Even though the above syntaxes allow T61Strings, the DCE Naming
# Syntax itself only supports PrintableStrings.  Recall that the
# PrintableString character set consists of the following characters
# (one of which is the space character) [Ref: X.208 (the ASN.1 spec)]:
#	abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
#	ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
#	01234 56789.:,'+-=()?/
# The NumericString character set consists of the following characters
# (one of which is the space character) [Ref: X.208]:
#	01234 56789
# Note also that the DCE Naming Syntax itself also includes the escape
# character `\', which does not occur in the PrintableString character
# set, but it is not intended that `\' occur in the X.500 name per se of
# an object -- only in the DCE Naming Syntax name of the object.  The
# rationale for this stems from the following excerpt from F.500
# concerning character repertoire:
#	    "Directory information will be entered and stored locally
#	using a character repertoire suitable to the country where the
#	directory is located.  More than one character repertoire may be
#	needed to cover different languages or to provide for access
#	from different types of communication terminals.
#	    However, in order to provide international public service,
#	the character repertoire to be used internationally should be
#	limited to CCITT standardized sets, i.e., the IA5 and T.61
#	character repertoires.
#	    For the intercommunication between public directory
#	services, the repertooires may be agreed to bilaterally.
#	    However, where no such agreements exists, the character
#	repertoire to be used shall consist only of those characters
#	defined as "printable string" in Recommendation X.208.
#	Furthermore, those Administrations which use character
#	repertoires other than this repertoire shall provide suitable
#	conversion of the information into this character repertoire for
#	directory requests from Administrations with which no bilateral
#	agreement has been reached.
#	    Subscribers have to be instructed on the use of the
#	appropriate character repertoires."
#
# MATCHING: The ASN.1-identifier of the matching-rule for the
# 	attribute-values of the attribute-type, specified in the ASN.1
# 	definition of the attribute-type.  Usually, this is determined
#	by the attribute-syntax, but it can be different.  Currently,
#	the following are supported:
#
#	CEM:	case-exact-string-matching -- leading, trailing, and
#		multiple consecutive internal spaces are ignored;
#		otherwise, the strings must be of the same length and
#		corresponding characters are identical.
#
#	CIM:	case-ignore-string-matching -- same as CES, except that
#		characters differing in their case only are considered
#		to match.
#
#	PM:	printable-string-matching -- same as CES.
#
#	NM:	numeric-string-matching -- same as CES, except that ALL
#		spaces are ignored.
#
#	-:	unspecified
