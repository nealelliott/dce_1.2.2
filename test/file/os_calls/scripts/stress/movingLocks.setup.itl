#  movingLocks.setup.itl -
#	Setup script for the movingLocks.itl script.  Defines the minimum
#	number of spokes needed for the test (currently 3).  Your
#	free to add more.
#
#  NOTE:
#	No machine names are given, so you must supply them via
#	the AUTO_SPOKE environment variable.  Also the movingLocks.itl
#	script creates a fileset and mount point to work in, so the 
#	initial working directory (/tmp) is not important.
