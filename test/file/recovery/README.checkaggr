Usage of checkaggr tool
-----------------------

Terms

  Tool
   The checkaggr tool described here

  Test program
   The test program that generates the source aggregate for the tool.

  Driver                   
   The script that drives the test program and the tool.

  Driver Verifier
   A script that the driver supplies to the tool to verify the 
   "stability" of the aggregate. Salvage verification is done by the 
   tool by default. Additional verification e.g. mounting filesets
   from the aggregate and executing some special high level consistency 
   tests, needs to be done by the Driver Verifier Script.
  
   The tools accepts different Driver Verifier scripts to be executed 
   after recovery and after salvage.

Prerequisites
-------------

1. The tools requires 2 extra "scratch pad" aggregates apart from
   the one being tested. The scratch pad aggregates are called
   Copy and Backup aggregates respectively. These scratch pad aggregates
   must be of the SAME SIZE as the source aggregate.

2. The commands salvage, dd, metamucil, scp, asdb should be accessible
   for execution through the PATH environment variable.

Operation
---------

The default behaviour of the tool is
  	- freeze the source aggregate
	- make backup and copy aggregates.
  	- run salvage -verify on the copy.
  	- run salvage -recover -verify on the copy
  	- run salvage -norecover on the copy if errors from previous step
  	- unfreeze the source aggregate
   
Switches
--------
All the switches are optional. But it is recommended that 
the switches -log, -badAggrDir, -badAggrNamePrefix always be used.

     -help   
      Display the usage message for the checkaggr tool.

     -log <log file name>    
      Log file name
      Default - /tmp/checkaggr.log.<process-id>

     -badAggrDir <pathname>  
      Directory to store bad aggregate copies.
      Default - /tmp/badaggr

     -badAggrNamePrefix  <string> 
      Prefix to the name of such bad aggregate copies.
      Default - badaggr.<date.time>

     -saveBadAggrUserData 
      The saved copies of bad aggregates contain the user data too.
      Default - the user data is stripped out of the copies of bad aggregates.


     -srcAggr <source aggregate name>   
      Default - /dev/epia
  
     -backupAggr <backup aggregate name> 
      Default - /dev/epib

     -copyAggr <copy aggregate name>   
      Default - /dev/epic


     -freezeOnly     
      Freeze the source aggregate and return. 

     -freezeAsync  
      Do not wait for aggregate to be frozen. The default is to wait for
      the freeze to complete.
      If this option is specified, -freezeOnly also has to be specified. 

     -unfreezeOnly   
      Unfreeze the source aggregate and return. 

     -leaveFrozen    
      Do not unfreeze the aggregate in the end.

     -numIOBeforeFreeze <number of I/Os allowed before aggregate freezes>  
      Default - zero i.e. freeze immediately


     -noRecovery     
      Do not recover the copy aggregate.
  
     -noSalvage         
      Do not salvage the copy aggregate


     -postRecoveryVerifyCmd  <command>  
      The command (with appropriate arguments) to run after recovery to 
      check high level consistency.
      Default - none

     -postSalvageVerifyCmd   <filename>  
      The command (with appropriate arguments) to run after salvage to 
      check high level consistency.
      Default - none
