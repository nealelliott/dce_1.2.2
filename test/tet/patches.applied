I found a second bug in the realease 1.10 of TET.
Of course, This bug has been reported to the implementer of TET.
However, the CMLib test suite needs the bug was fixed.

The bug is in the file $TET_ROOT/src/posix_c/tcc/startit.c. See the fix in the
following lines :

diff startit.c startit.c.bug
1324c1324
<     sortlist = (TPRS **) TET_MALLOC(sizeof(node) * count);
- ---
>     sortlist = (TPRS **) TET_MALLOC(sizeof(TPRS) * count);

the right line is the first as node is declared as following:
TPRS *node;

With this fix, the size of the array is devided by 8. This is very important
because the array is very big (one structure TPRS per line in the TET journal).

Best regards,
Mark.
