README for dfs.fmul (fileset move under load)

How to run:

Be sure to be cell_admin.

Start up as many servers as necessary.  The -d option will provide
debugging information, if needed.  The servers are not required
to be on different machines.

Start the client, giving:
	* (with -f) the configuration file (such as simple.cf, which
	  locks, tests, and unlocks a file).
	* (-s) the number of servers.
	* (-n) the name of the file to be manipulated.
	* (-p) the path to the file to be manipulated.
If debugging information is needed, the -d option can also be added.

Needed:
- A shell script to set up the servers, and to handle parsing
some arguments for the servers.

- A threaded client, so that the blocking calls (currently, l_lock)
can be made.

- More configuration files.

- Expand the code to handle more complex problems than locking.  This
shouldn't be very difficult, as all the supporting code is in place.
