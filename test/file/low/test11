# Revision 1.1.4.4  1992/10/28  18:14:44  jaffe
# 	Transarc delta: fred-ot5472-use-testhome-variable 1.1
# 	  Selected comments:
# 	    Fixed the fs and low tests to correctly use TESTTOP.  We were setting a
# 	    variable, testhome, as the location for the test scripts and executables,
# 	    but we did not use it to execute C programs.
# 	    (I checked out some scripts which did not need this change.)
# 	    Use testhome when referencing C executables.
# 	Transarc delta: jess-add-dumpkernel-in-low-tests 1.5
# 	  Selected comments:
# 	    Add function call (icl_DumpKernel) in the test suite. In case of running
# 	    error of C programmes in the test suite the "icl_DumpKernel" function
# 	    will be called in errex() to do the kernel trace. The dump file is located
# 	    in "/tmp/prog#.kernel.dump.pid". You have to have the debug flag set to
# 	    have the dump file.
# 	    See above.
# 	    Process another C file and add "low" as dump file header.
# 	    Turn on the prog3 debug flags.
# 	    It should not create the zero length dumpfile when there is nothing wrong.
# 	Transarc delta: jess-ot5320-fix-fs-low-testhome 1.1
# 	  Selected comments:
# 	    The fs and low test shell scripts have the following if statement
# 	    if [ "$TESTTOP" = "`pwd`" ]
# 	    then
# 	    UTIL_DIR=../util
# 	    testhome=$TESTTOP
# 	    else
# 	    UTIL_DIR=$TESTTOP/util
# 	    testhome=$TESTTOP/$testSuiteType
# 	    fi
# 	    The problem is that variable testSuiteType is not defined at this time.
# 	    See above.

# 	Transarc delta: jess-ot5196-low-test-err-redirection 1.1
# 	  Selected comments:
# 	    Redirect stderr to stdout from running programs of low/tests

# Revision 1.1.4.2  1992/08/28  18:17:02  jaffe
# 	Transarc delta: rajesh-clean-low-tests 1.5
# 	  Selected comments:
# 	    To remove make and clean options from the low test suite. To change
# 	    the scripts to use common shell functions. To create a file
# 	    fs_functionsScript with the common shell functions in the util
# 	    directory.
# 	    To remove make and clean options. To change the scripts to use common
# 	    shell functions from util/fs_functionsScript instead of inline code.
# 	    Modify scripts to follow coding standards, simplify the code, increase
# 	    readability etc.
# 	    No changes yet
# 	    More of above.
# 	    Modify the tests to give them a simpler logical structure, modularity,
# 	    readability ( one command per line) and to change then to use the
# 	    common function created earlier.
# 	    See above.
# 	    Modification of rtest1 and rtest2 to use the utility functions
# 	    correctly.

# 	Transarc delta: fred-3754-change-script-name 1.1
# 	  Selected comments:
# 	    To clean up a number of defects with the tests.  In addition to defect
# 	    3754, the changes also fix defects 3750 and 3748.
# 	    Fixed setting of TESTTOP variable.

# Revision 1.1.2.2  1992/05/21  12:50:00  jaffe
# 	Transarc delta: fred-merge-tests 1.1
# 	  Selected comments:
# 	    Created this delta to merge Phil Hirsch's final DFS test code changes with
# 	    the test code that the OSF had.  Hopefully, this means we and the OSF
# 	    should be looking at the same test code.
# 	    Changes to facilitate merge of local DFS test code with the OSF's.
# 	Transarc delta: fred-remove-sys 1.1
# 	  Selected comments:
# 	    To remove dependency on the AFS sys command in the test scripts.
# 	    To remove dependency on AFS sys command.
