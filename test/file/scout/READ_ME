test1: parameter parsing

  The basic parsing functionality will be tested in part with a 
  script that will test for cases that do not result in scout
  execution.  The options to be tested will include help, 
  invalid parameter specification, bogus frequencies, and bogus
  attention threshold pairs.

test2: functionality

  A second file will contain a list of commands to be executed
  that should result in a successful scout startup.  It is up to 
  the user to verify that the attention thresholds match the ones 
  given in the parameters.  The user may also have to perform other 
  operations to exercise scout to test the thresholds (e.g. write 
  a program to fill a partion to n%). We will include such programs 
  in future releases after we get a chance to test scout ourselves.  
  The user will also want to test to see that multiple instances of 
  scout can co-exist on the same machine.  This can be accomplished 
  by opening multiple windows and running two or more scout commands 
  each one in each window.

  A server crash/shutdown may be simulated by issuing the bos commands 
  commands in test2.  Read the test plan for a more complete description
  of their usage.
