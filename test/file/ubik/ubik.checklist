Ubik test coverage
------------------

Ubik is tested using the utst_server, utst_client and udebug binaries. The
tests present setup the utst_server on all ubik server machines, and use the
utst_client with { -get, -trunc, -inc, -qget, -mget, -minc, -incf } switches
to make changes to the database. udebug is used to display the state of each
utst_server.  Most of the necessary tasks can be completed using the
utst_driver script, which will use 'bos' for most of its remote actions.
If you want to do things by hand, then read the information in HANDTEST.

utst_driver -init

This configures the name space and security for utst_server, installs and
runs the server.  After completing this stage, you could use bos to kill
and disable the server and then start the server by hand and run various
actions by hand.  You must be cell_admin to run this command.

utst_driver -trunc|-inc|-qget|-get|-mget|-minc|-incf

This runs the utst_client command with the various switches.  Run
"utst_driver -info" or "utst_driver -proc" for more information.

utst_driver -shut

This will kill all of the processes started by "utst_driver -init" and
will remove the entries from the DCE space (rpc groups, security, etc.)
You must be cell_admin to run this command.

utst_driver -status

Run the 'udebug' command with one or more servers (running utst_server)
specified as on the command line.


New tests

1. utst_server command line testing

	-nsgroup	CDS group name	This should be setup beforehand
					/.:/subsys/dce/dfs/utst should be the
					default. Use valid/invalid/existing/
					non-existing group names and check for
					expected behavior. Setup CDS group
					with empty/1/2/3 members.
	-sleep				valid/invalid values for sleep time.

2. utst_server running on 1, 2, 3 servers (in same cell). Use udebug on the
   utst_server to figure out which is sync site and which server votes for 
   which. Kill one server after another and use udebug to monitor the sync site
   and votes. Restart the killed utst_server(s) and monitor the results again.
   Measure time to reach quorum in each case.

3. utst_client command line testing - same as utst_server.
   Use -trunc, -try, -get, -inc, -mget repeatedly and check results.

4. Run multiple utst_clients and do -mget (stress). While running multiple
   clients, kill each utst_server and monitor results. Killing 2 servers out
   of 3 should break quorum causing clients to return UNOQUORUM error.

5. Try a 3 server configuration with IP addresses A, B and C (A < B < C).
   Start server on C and then "utst_client -incf".  Wait 5 minutes.
   Then start the servers on B and A.  After a few minutes, quorum should
   be reached.
