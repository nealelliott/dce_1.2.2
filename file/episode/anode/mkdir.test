# 	  Selected comments:
# 	    Closing only so I can fix another bug.
# 	    So far only new tests and supporting code are done.  The seems to behave
# 	    as expected since NBS and FB changes aren't in yet.
# 	    Doesn't compile now.
# 	    More work on freed block part of new block security.
# 	    Now compiles but new code disabled.
# 	    Close to edit another delta.
# 	    Freed Block fragment stuff now seems to work.  all_tests succeeds.  This
# 	    could be incorporated in to a release if anyone cared.
# 	    Need bigger aggregate.
# 	    Due to a change in episode configuration 2.15,16,or 17, the interface to
# 	    buffer_EquivTran changed.  It no longer returns a code.

# It is useful to run this test close to the disk space limit so that it
# is forced to move directories when fragmented ones grow.  This is much
# harder on the logging system than allowing them to grow in-place.
