addsite -

  BASIC:

  newtest -
    - specify aggregate name via device name and aggregate identifier.
    - specify small and large maxsiteage values.
    - specify a non-local cell.
    - RO is on same aggregate as RW (clone)
    - RO is on a different aggregate from RW (copyclone)
    - RO is on a different server from RW
    - Use lsreplicas and rmsite to make sure the fileset has been replicated
    - Verify that the status of the RO changes from "invalid" to "valid".

  etest4 -
    - Run command with fileset name, full qualified server name, LFS aggregate
      name. Do not use the "-fileset", "-server" and "-aggregate" switches.
      Similar test also in rtest1, rtest2.

  test12 -
    - Run the command with a fileset name, server name and aggregate name.
      Do not use the "-fileset", "-server" and "-aggregate" switches.
    - Run the previous command with a different fileset name.
    - Run the previous command with a fileset identifier instead of a fileset
      name. Do not use the "-fileset" switch.

      maximum site age interval. 
      Do not use the "-fileset", "-server", "-aggregate" and "-maxsiteage"
      switches.
    - Run the command with max site agr interval, aggregate name, cell name,
      fileset identifier, and server name (in that order). Use "-maxsiteage",

    - repeat the command with same fileset, server and aggregate values.
    - For release replicated fileset, try replicating a fileset first on a
      different server (server not housing the RW). This fails because the 
      first addsite should be on the same server and aggregate for a release
      replicated fileset.
    - set maxsiteage to 0 and negative values.

      invalid max site age.
      Use "-fileset", "-server", "-aggregate" and "-maxsiteage" switches.

      aggregate name and max site age, and invalid value for cell name.

      switches.

    - check if access to the fileset being moved returns busy status. The
      fileset state should be busy during the move. Access can be made via
      the glue to verify this situation.
    - Abort the move, and the fileset being moved should be undamaged.
    - A clean abort should result if insufficient space in destination 
      aggregate
    - When target and destination aggregates are same, move should print
      warning and abort.
    - check if the backup fileset on the source aggregate is removed after the
      move is completed. It should be.
    - Do an fts update on the moved fileset to see if replication has noticed
      the new location of the fileset.
    - check if the moved fileset's site is updated in the FLDB.
    - check if destination aggregate space is appropriately decremented and
      source aggregate space is incremented after the move is complete.
    - start many accesses to a single file in the fileset to be moved and hold
      on to these accesses during the move. Continue the access after the move.
      This is to determine if fileset state and token state is handled 
      properly during and after the move.
