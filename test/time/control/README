Dtscp is depricated for DCE Release 1.1.

Dtscp functionality is provided by dcecp. There are functional
tests (run under the TET test harness) that exercise
the dts object in dcecp.

These tests are for the command syntax interface of the dtscp
time control program, and exercise the internal functionality of
dtsd without upsetting a running system.

The test_dtscp script calls the dtscp.ksh script, and redirects the output
into a file.  The data in that file is then compared with the data 
in an expected output file to check for any differences.

If there are no differences, a few more quick dtscp commands are
sent to the screen to verify some things that cannot be done using
an expected output file.  If the actual-to-expected files were no
different, and no errors were generated by the rest of the dtscp
commands, then the test has passed.

It is OK if the test 'fails' when checking the state of dtsd,
as it is possible for dtsd to be 'Syncronizing' when the
expected result is 'On'.

For 1.1, there are serviceability ERROR messages generated by dtsd
that are caused by testing the server entry name, server principal name 
and server group name.  Depending on your route settings, these may 
appear on the stderr of the test.  They should not affect the test results.


NOTE:

THE ENVIRONMENT THAT THIS TEST IS RUN IN IS VERY IMPORTANT.  IT IS
CURRENTLY DESIGNED TO RUN IN A TWO NODE CELL, WHERE ONE NODE IS A
DTS LOCAL SERVER, AND THE OTHER IS A DTS CLERK.  THERE ARE TWO
EXPECTED OUTPUT FILES, ONE IF THE TEST IS RUN ON A SERVER, AND THE
OTHER IF IT IS RUN ON A CLERK.

FAILURE TO RUN IN THIS CONFIGURATION WILL RESULT IN SPURIOUS ERRORS
AND FALSE NEGATIVES.
