# HISTORY
# $TALog: restoredb-2.2e,v $
# Revision 1.4  1996/01/21  09:47:24  hyer
# Changes to make the backup test scripts with the callout routines for
# mount and unmount in DCE 1.2.
#
# Added cm checkfilesets and cleaned up test to run with callout routines
# [from r1.3 by delta hyer-7265-backup-test-mods-for-callout-routines, r1.1]
#
# Revision 1.3  1995/12/06  15:24:24  hyer
# The backup test scripts were not working. Most of the tests either
# failed or never ran. Made significant changes to all scripts to make
# them work:
#
# Added function CATCHEXEC that does the same thing as catch "exec ..."
# but also displays each command and the response as well as any error codes
# that are returned from the exec.
#
# Added a loop in is_butc_ready to wait up to 200 seconds for the butc
# process to start, sleeping 10 seconds between checks.
#
# Changed the expected command output to match the messages generated
# by the current version of the code.
#
# Added sleeps around some of the tape I/O commands to keep them from
# failing because the device wasn't ready.
#
# Added chmod ogu+rwx commands after each fts crmount to give the test
# scripts access to the test filesets
#
#
# [from r1.2 by delta hyer-7109-backup-test-changes, r1.1]
#
# Revision 1.2  1994/01/07  18:02:30  davecarr
# Upgraded tests to work with expect-5.1.3.  Also moved some configuration
# dependencies from restoredb-cmd to generic.exp.  In the process, some
# variables had "dbr_" prepended to them to indicate that they are used only
# for the restoredb tests.
#
# Upgraded test to work with expect-5.1.3.
# [from r1.1 by delta davecarr-db4736-bak-restoredb-tests, r1.2]
#
# Revision 1.1  1993/11/24  18:44:46  davecarr
#    This the first pass at automating tests for the bak restoredb command.  They
# work with expect-4.3.  They will need to be updated to work with expect,
# version 5.
#
# Initial checkin.  Test works with expect-4.3.
