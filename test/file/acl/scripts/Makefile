# 	Transarc delta: jaffe-ot5942-make-test-tree-work 1.1
# 	  Selected comments:
# 	    Now that the test tree installs in dcetest/dce1.0, this delta
# 	    cleans up the Transarc files so that there are no extraneous additions
# 	    to the export tree, and so that all appropriate files are installed.
# 	    Add Makefile to install scripts
