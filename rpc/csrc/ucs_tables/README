The files in this directory are converter tables between
local code sets <==> UCS-2 (two octet form of ISO 10646).
DCE 1.1 RPC I18N extension requires that these conversions
are available as a fall back conversion method for RPC code
set interoperability.

Since local code set conversion method differs platform by
platform, OSF provides these tables only, so each vendor
can integrate these tables into their own converters.  In
case of OSF/1, these tables were integrated into iconv 
converters.

Following is a list of converter tables OSF ships with DCE 1.1:

/* Acronym explanation:
   ISO8859-*  is one of a family of commonly used single-byte
              code sets. ISO 8859-1 is often called "Latin-1"
   UCS-2      two octet form of ISO 10646, the very large
              universal code set
   FSS-UTF    File System Safe UCS Transformation Format for
              ISO 10646. While UCS-2 is only suitable as a wide
              character (wchar_t) encoding, FSS-UTF is an alternate
              mapping that is suitable as a multibyte (char) encoding
   eucJP      Japanese EUC
   eucKR      Korean EUC
   eucTW      Taiwanese EUC
   SJIS       Japanese Shift-JIS (often used on Japanese PCs)
