# 
# 	Short Description                    (text): needs work for accuracy, utility
# 
# 	While trying to follow this checklist, I encountered a number of
# 	inaccuracies, missing information, and steps that served no real useful
# 	purpose.  Specifically:
# 	  -  You must either run the core DCE services on a non-DFS machine, or
# 	     on the machine with the highest IP address of the machines in the
# 	     test cell so that the DCE core server does not get elected the
# 	     fldb sync site.
# 
# 	  -  missing the '-process flserver' arguement to the bos restart command
# 	     to restart the flservers so that they can elect a sync site.
# 
# 	  -  Information on setting up to run the ubik unit tests is extraneous
# 	     since there is no step that tells you to run them, nor is it well
# 	     understood how to run them.
# 
# 	  -  To determine the fldb sync site, you should check amoung the members
# 	     of the /.:/fs group, not the /.:/subsys/dce/dfs/utst group.
# 
# 	  -  After shutting down the initial sync site, you should verify that a
# 	     new sync site is elected from the remaining flservers before
# 	     re-starting the old sync site.
# 
# 	  -  The last step should be to run the fts short test, periodically
# 	     determining the sync site, stopping the flserver on that machine,
# 	     waiting to see that a new sync site is elected, restarting the
# 	     old sync site's flserver, and verifying that it sees the same
# 	     fldb info as the machines left running.

############################################################################

	A. Setup DCE and DFS

           1. Run dce_config on each of 4 machines,
 	      choosing the DCE CORE server options (SEC and CDS) on
	      the 1st machine and the FLDB server option on the
	      other 3. These FLDB server machines must be configured
	      as dfs clients as well. It is highly recommended that
	      you also run 3 local DTS servers to maintain accurate
	      time within your cell. There can be no more than a 30
	      second difference in system times on the fldb server
	      machines.

           NOTE 1: You will be instructed in a later step to reboot the 
                   master fldb server (the sync site) and then to do some 
                   fldb work while the sync site system is down.  This is
		   why a separate DCE CORE Servers machine is used.

	   NOTE 2: If the machine is a DECstation (pmax), you
	           must have previously installed and booted up on
  	           a dfs kernel. If the machine is an HP, you
		   must have previously installed and booted up
		   on a kernel that supports extensions.

	B. Verify setup

           1. On each machine, list the fileset location database entries.

                > fts lsfldb 

	      The output should be the same on all machines.

  	      The following output is an example of what you would see
	      for a 3 machine cell, cobbler, dce12 and valentine, each
	      machine acting as a fl server and file server exporting
	      a native fileset.

                < dce12.u3  
                <         readWrite   ID 0,,4  valid
                <         readOnly    ID 0,,5  invalid
                <         backup      ID 0,,6  invalid
                < number of sites: 1
                <  server         flags     aggr   siteAge principal    owner
                < dce12.osf.org     RW      /u3     0:00:00 hosts/dce12 <nil>
                < 
                < root.dfs  
                <         readWrite   ID 0,,1  valid
                <         readOnly    ID 0,,2  invalid
                <         backup      ID 0,,3  invalid
                < number of sites: 1
                <  server         flags    aggr   siteAge principal      owner
                < cobbler.osf.org   RW     /u1     0:00:00 hosts/cobbler <nil>
                <
                < val.u4  
                <         readWrite   ID 0,,7  valid
                <         readOnly    ID 0,,8  invalid
                <         backup      ID 0,,9  invalid
                < number of sites: 1
                <  server         flags    aggr   siteAge principal      owner
                < valentine.osf.org   RW   /u4    0:00:00 hosts/valentine <nil>
                < ----------------------
                < Total FLDB entries that were successfully enumerated: 3 (0 failed)

           2. Add an entry and check that it can be seen from all FLDBs.

 	      For example ('\' is for readability of this document only):

                > fts crfldbentry -ftname val.u2 -server valentine  -aggrid 4 \
                                                                   -localauth

	      Then, on each machine:

 	        > fts lsfldb 

	      And the output on all machines should now end with
              Total = Previous Total + 1.

                < Total FLDB entries that were successfully enumerated: 4 (0 failed)


	C. Determine the location of the master fileset location database 
           server (also known as the "sync site") and shut it down.

	   1. You can determine which machine is serving as the sync site by
              using "udebug". On each fldb machine type the following:

                > udebug -rpcgroup /.:/fs -long 

              The udebug command output looks like this (the '\' breaks 
              a line for readability purposes of this document):

                > udebug -group /.:/fs -long
                < Host 130.106.234.527, his time is 0
                < Vote: Last yes vote for 130.106.234.527 at -13 \
                <       (sync site);  Last vote started at -13  <<<<=====
                < Local db version is 743098730.5
                < I am sync site until 77 (2 servers)   <<<<=============
                < Recovery state 1f
                < Sync site's db version is 743098730.5
                < 0 locked pages, 0 of them for write
                < This server started at -10699
                  
                < [ output about votes received from other fldb's ]
                 
              Note the lines delimited by the arrow (<<<====).  These lines 
              show that this machine is the sync site.  If udebug is run on a 
              machine that does not house the sync site, the output
              will be very similar, but the lines would read 

                 < Vote: Last yes vote for 130.106.234.527 at -13 (not \
                        sync site);  Last vote started at -13
              and
                 < I am not sync site

              respectively.

	      There should be one and only one sync site.


	   2. Shutdown the sync site machine, to simulate a crash or network 
              partition. Do NOT have the dce and dfs services start up
	      upon reboot.

                 sync_site> shutdown -r now 


        D. Verify determination of a new master fldb server
           
           When the sync site is shut down in a cell, the remaining fldb server
           processes begin "voting" to "elect" a system to become the new sync
           site.  This process commences when the fldb servers detect that the 
           original sync site has gone down, and should complete in a short 
           number of minutes.
  
	   Although read access to the fldb is now possible without
	   quorum (as of 103a), there is a small window during which
	   you do do not have read access, so you will either succeed
	   with an fts lsfldb command or get the following:

	   machine2> fts lsfldb
	   Could not access the FLDB for attributes
	   Error: no quorum elected (dfs / ubk)

           To verify that the fldb servers that were not shut down commence 
           this voting and elect a new sync site:
           
           After shutting down the original sync site, wait about 5 
           minutes, then re-run the "udebug" command described above in 
           step C.1. on each of the machines that were not shut down.  One
           and only one of the machines should report that it is now 
	   the sync site.  
           		
	E. Update FLDB.

	   1. Remove one entry and add another entry while the former 
              master fl server is not running ('\' is for the readability of 
              this document only):

	        machine2> fts delfldbentry -fileset val.u2
		machine2> fts crfldbentry -ftname val.u3 -server valentine \
                                          -aggrid 5 -localauth

           2. On each fldb machine still running, list the fileset 
	      location database entries.

	        > fts lsfldb 

	      The output should be the same on all machines. When the
              fts command tries to report on filesets exported from the
              old sync site machine, you will correctly see an error from  
              the machine that was the sync site and is currently not 
              running dce and dfs.

                < Error: communications failure (dce / rpc)

		
	F. Re-start DCE and DFS on the machine that WAS the sync site.

	        > sh -x /etc/rc.dce

	G. List the filesest location database entries on all machines.

		> fts lsfldb

	     The output should be the same.


	H. Test fileset read/write access.

           1. Test fileset read/write access from all machines
	      to all filesets:
                 
                 a. for Episode filesets, you can use the dfs.lock system test.
                    Edit the lock.data file to reflect your configuration, 
                    desired testing parameters, and desired file locations,
                    then run the dfs.lock test (see the README in the source
                    tree at <dce_path>/src/test/systest/file for more complete
                    information on running the dfs.lock test), capturing the 
                    output in a log file (the following example is for the
                    Bourne or Korn shell):
                  
                    > test/systest/file/dfs.lock -f lock.data > lock.log 2>&1

                    Search the log file for lines beginning with "ITERATION"
                    to see the status of the test passes.  You can then look
                    in the log file for a description of what happened during
                    each of the passes that failed.

                 b. for native filesets, you can use the dfs.glue system test.
                    Edit the glue.data file to reflect your configuration, 
                    desired testing parameters, and desired file locations,
                    then run the dfs.glue test (see the README in the source
                    tree at <dce_path>/src/test/systest/file for more complete
                    information on running the dfs.glue test), capturing the 
                    output in a log file (the following example is for the
                    Bourne or Korn shell):
                   
		    > test/systest/file/dfs.glue glue.data HH > glue.log 2>&1

		    where HH is the # of hours you want the test to run.

                    Search the log file for the string "FAILED" to identify
                    places where the test clients failed.


	I. Test fileset manipulation commands.

	   1. Run the automated fts functional tests in test/file/fts.  
              While the test is running, do the following several times to 
              verify that the fldb servers are operating correctly:
                 
                a. follow the instructions in step C.1. above for determining
                   the sync site.

                b. shut down the fldb server process on the sync site system:
                 
                   > bos stop -server /.:/hosts/<host> -process flserver

                c. follow the instructions in steps D and E for verifying 
                   that a new sync site was elected, and for updating the fldb.
                   
                d. after about 30 minutes, restart the flserver on the machine
                   the was the sync site:
 
                   > bos start -server /.:/hosts/<host>  -process flserver

                e. follow the instructions for step G to verify that the 
                   fldb servers are once again in sync.

	   Note that fldb writes and even some fldb reads will fail while
	   the flservers are in the process of regaining quorum but fldb
	   writes and reads should succeed once there is a quorum.
