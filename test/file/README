The runall script in this directory will execute a selected
subset of all tests overnight unattended. This script and the
runall subscripts in the tests directories are self-configuring.
The subset of tests to run can be changed via the "tests" array
in the script; select tests from the list given. A script,
copytests.sh, is provided to copy the selected tests into LFS in
the target DFS cell. The runall tests must be executed out of LFS.
Large aggregates cause the tests to run longer than the listed
times.


The check script is not typically used at OSF.

The config directory contains utilities used by some of the other
tests.

The delegation tests were originally written to test delegation using 
user space admin lists.  Only kernel delegation using LFS ACL's 
is supported in DCE 1.1. which means this test is not applicable to
DCE 1.1.  

The itl directory does not contain a test but instead a number of 
support libraries for tests.  See the ReadMe.

The tests in the following directories are not typically run at the
OSF:

os_calls
naming
zlc
update
