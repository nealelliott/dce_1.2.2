# 	Renamed this file from SECRGY.CFG to DCESERGY.DATA to be more
# 	consistent with names for other security system tests.  Changed a lot
# 	of names to either make this test run multiple copies in the same
# 	cell, or make names more consistent.  Also made the definitions
# 	conditional on whether or not the variable already existed.
