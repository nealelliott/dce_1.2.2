Hierarchical Cell Reliability Test (HCLREL001)
----------------------------------------------

The system test in this directory exercises some of the intercell
capabilities needed in a hierarchical cell. The test is intended 
to provide a building block upon which to build more complete 
tests in the future, so additional intercell testing sequences can
be added to it easily.  Intercell operations are tested by 
executing commands which include the target cell name in their 
arguments. 

This test uses a "run" control script as a test driver in the same 
way as many of the other DCE system tests. The run script is 
run.hcell, installed in the directory 

	   $TET_ROOT/system/directory/cds/bin. 

This test only needs to be installed on one machine in one cell in
order to be executed between multiple cells. Installation is
accomplished using dcetest_config. 

Intercell interoperability must be established between the cell 
where this test is installed and each of the target cells before 
the test is run. This can be done using the system test hclcfg001 
or it can be done manually.

The command line syntax for this test is:

     run.hcell {-l loops | -t hours} [other opts] hclrel001 {cells}

where:
  -l <number>   Number of external loops or passes to run.
  -t <hours>    Time in hours.  Accepts decimal point, eg 
		  -t .5 = 30 minutes.
  Note that -l and -t are mutually exclusive, and one or the other 
  is required.

other opts are:
  -c            Keep the journal files from all successful iterations.
  -e <number>   Max errors-in-a-row allowed before punting test
		  (default=50).
  -E <number>   Max total errors allowed before punting test
		  (default=500).
  -h            List test-specific options.

and cells are:

  one or more complete cellnames separated by spaces.

The available test sequences will be executed with each of the 
specified cells in turn as the target.
