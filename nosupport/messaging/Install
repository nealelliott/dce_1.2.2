			    Queue Manager (qmgr)

Before you start:

    Create principal for each queue manager you will run.  Every instance
    of the qmgr should have its own DCE principal.  (This is generally true
    of all DCE services.)
    "my-qmgr" (passwd "xyzzy"), putting in group "qmgrs"

    Make a private working directory for the qmgr and go there:
	mkdir /opt/dcelocal/var/Q		-- or the directory you want
	cd /opt/dcelocal/var/Q

    Create keytab file with dcecp:
	dcecp> keytab create K -local -storage my-keyfile \
		-data {my-qmgr plain 1 xyzzy}
    or file with rgy_edit:
	rgy_edit=> kta -f my-keyfile -p my-qmgr -pw xyzzy
    The full path this keytab thus /opt/dcelocal/var/Q/my-keyfile
    (You can, of course, pick any directory or filename you want for the
    keytab file. The local system user which will run the qmgr must have
    read and write access to it.)

Initialize backing stores and ACL database:

    cd /opt/dcelocal/var/Q
    /some/path/qmgr -p my-qmgr -k /opt/dcelocal/var/Q/my-keyfile -i

Run it:

    (assume qmgr is in your path)
    qmgr -p my-qmgr -k FILE:/opt/dcelocal/var/Q/my-keyfile \
	-e /.:/subsys/Q/my-queue

    ("my-qmgr" needs write access to /.:/subsys/Q)
    * the "-A" flag turns off ACL checking.

    Environment variables:

    Rather then set those values on the command line, you may use the
    environment variables:
	QMGR_KEYFILE
	QMGR_PRINCIPAL
	QMGR_NS_ENTRY

    Input parameters are checked in this order:
	1. command line args
	2. env variables
	3. DCED attributes
    Note: interaction with DCED may not work (yet).

    Command line arguments summary:
	-p qmgr_prin         set principal to run as
	-e ns_entry          set NS entry to which to export
	-k keytab_file       keytab to use - eg, "FILE:/opt/dcelocal/Q/KEYS"
	-w svc_destination   set svc dest - eg, "*:STDERR:-;FILE:/tmp/mos.log"
			     (sends all messages to both stderr and the file)
	-i                   initialize files and exit
	-o uuid              object UUID to export to namespace
	-A                   disable ACL checking

    You may also set the destination for serviceability messages with -w.
    You may also turn off all ACL checking with the -A flag.

Accessing the qmgr
    Once it us running, you access the qmgr through /.:/subsys/Q/my-qmgr.
    For example, the queue jjb-deposits is /.:/subsys/Q/my-qmgr/jjb-deposits

Issues
    Multiple qmgrs on same host
	If you want to run more than one qmgr on a host, they must export
	different object UUIDs.  (This is true of any DCE server.)
	This is because (skimping over all the details)  servers register
	interface-object pair mappings with the endpoint mapper.  Since
	the interface UUID is always the same, you must choose an object
	UUID.  (a default is hard-coded)  "uuidgen" will generate a UUID.

			Installation of moscp

After building moscp, either:
    copy the message catalogs
	dcemos.cat
	dcemcp.cat
    to the appropriate place, something like /usr/lib/nls/msg/C (HPUX).
or
    set the environment variable that determines where message catalogs
    live to include where you put the above two message catalogs.
