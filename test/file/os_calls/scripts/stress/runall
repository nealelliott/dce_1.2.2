#
# This script intends to run all distributed tests in this directory.
# Before running the script, read README carefully and set up those
# setup files for each scripts if there are no such files. This script
# will use rsh (auto_spoke) to run our remote ITL file_test so be
# careful in case of running script with no window open and Hub exits
# abnormally there may be some "rsh" and "rshd" running in machines
# you stained. Check that and kill them manually.
