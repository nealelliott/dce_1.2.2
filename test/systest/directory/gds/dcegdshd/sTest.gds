#
# This setup file contains options for setting up the environment for 
# GDS system testing.  It is assumed that 4 machines exist, with GDS installed
# on each.  This script also disables checking for the cell that the GDS systest
# systems belong in, since GDS does not require a cell to run, and testing is
# only just begun.  Once the system test is stabilized, the GDS system will be 
# incorporated into a cell.  At this point, the only inportant variables are
# the machine definitions, the CELLNAME definition, and the GDS* definitions.
# 
# You will, of course, want to change the system names to something that is
# meaningful in your environment.  You will probably want to change the
# GDSDSADNPREFIX as well, though this is not necessary.  It may be necessary
# for you to change the GDS_DUAPORT and GDS_DSAPORT variables if ports 21000,
# 21001, and 21002 are already in use at your site.  It may also be necessary
# for you to change the GDS_DIR_ID if directory id 2 is already in use at your
# site.
