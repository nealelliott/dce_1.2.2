This directory contains the pioctl tester and the pioctl test scripts.
The tester is linked with file sys call library and ITL spoke library,
that means that you can call any of exported syscalls and do the 
distributed tests. Currently basic.scr is available to be run
to test the pioctl interface and to ensure that the functions
exported in ITL work. 

Note:

Before running "basic.scr" script be sure to have an exported aggregate.
By default the aggregate is "epi1".
