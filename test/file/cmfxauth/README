INTRODUCTION
------------

This directory contains the test suite described in detail in
"Test Plan for OSF-RFC 90.0: Security Enhancements for DCE DFS".
Below is a brief outline of the required test cell configuration,
and information on executing the tests.


IMPLEMENTATION
--------------

The test suite is implemented in Perl.  Therefore it is necessary to
ensure that Perl is accessible from the machine executing the tests.
Check that the first line of the following files contains the correct
path to the Perl executable:
    sectest.pl,
    secTestStartup.pl, secTestSetProt.pl,
    secTestRepAuth.pl, secTestFlAuth.pl,
    secTestRevokeAuth.pl,
    secTestBounds.pl, secTestBoundsWorker.pl


CELL CONFIGURATION:
-------------------

The complete test requires two cells, referred to here as the local cell
and the remote cell.  However, a command line switch allows an abbreviated
version of the test to be executed in just the local cell.

The local cell must contain at least two DFS server machines, A and B, while
the remote cell requires only a single DFS server machine, C.

The test script must be executed on either server A or B in the local cell.


RSH REQUIREMENTS:
-----------------

The test must be able to execute local commands on server machines A, B
and C, such as dfstrace, dfsexport, etc.  Thus entries must be made in
the appropriate file(s) to allow a root user on the server machine executing
the tests to perform remote executions on all three server machines.
See 'man rsh' for details.


TEST CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS:
------------------------------

Before executing the test suite, a number of configuration parameters
must be set in the file secconfig.pl.  Edit this file as indicated there.

NOTE: the executable named fxsecadvice, which is built as part of this
test suite, must be installed on each server machine.  The configuration
file secconfig.pl provides a place to specify a path to this command.


AUTHORIZATION REQUIREMENTS:
---------------------------

In editing the configuration file secconfig.pl, you must supply path names
in both the local and remote cell.  In the local cell, this path refers to
a directory in which the test will create a mount-point to a fileset;
in the remote cell, this path refers to a pre-existing file to be read.
The ACLs on these paths MUST be set so that they can be traversed by
an unauthenticated principal.  Similarly, the ACL on the pre-existing file
in the remote cell MUST allow it to be read by an unathenticated principal.

On server machines A and B in the local cell, the cell-administrator
principal must reside in the admin.ft and admin.rep lists, either directly
or via group membership.  Similarly, the cell-administrator principal
must reside in all admin.fl lists in the local cell.

In the remote cell, the local cell's cell-administrator principal must
reside in all admin.fl lists.  This requires establishing a trust
relationship between the two cells via 'dcecp registry connect'.


RUNNING TESTS:
--------------

Run the test suite by executing the sectest.pl script; no arguments are
required.

Local-cell-only testing can be specified via the '-l' switch.

Individual tests may be executed by supplying the test name(s) as command
line arguments to sectest.pl.  Valid test names are as follows:

    1) startup   : UI extensions test - startup options
    2) setprot   : UI extensions test - set protection levels
    3) repauth   : Server RPC authentication test - repserver
    4) flauth    : Server RPC authentication test - flserver
    5) revokeauth: Token-revoke authentication test
    6) bounds-un : CM-FX authn negotiation test - unauthn non-local-root
    7) bounds-ur : CM-FX authn negotiation test - unauthn local-root
    8) bounds-an : CM-FX authn negotiation test - authn non-local-root
    9) bounds-ar : CM-FX authn negotiation test - authn local-root

NOTE:
    1) The sectest.pl script must be executed as cell_admin and root.
    2) The test must be executed from, and log files must be written to,
       a non-DFS file system.


TEST RESULTS:
-------------

Test results are summarized to stdout at the completion of execution.

During the course of each test, messages printed to stdout indicate
actions that are taking place and any specific errors that are encountered.

To facilitate automated testing, test scripts must at times examine trace
logs, via dfstrace, and attempt to verify that expected actions have
taken place.  This can be a somewhat ad hoc methodology which may not detect
all incorrect behaviors; similarly, correct behaviors may be misinterpreted.
In practice though, this methodology works well.

Note: A number of tests must wait for an unbounded-time event to occur.
The waiting time is controlled by a variable defined in secconfig.pl.
If a test fails immediately after awakening from a sleep, try increasing
the wait time.
