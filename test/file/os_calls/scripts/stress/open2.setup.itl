#  open2.setup.itl -
#	Setup script for the open2.itl script.  Defines the actual
#	number of spokes needed for the test (2).
#
#  NOTE:
#	No machine names are given, so you must supply them via
#	the AUTO_SPOKE environment variable.
#	If you are testing local path versus DFS path (both ITL spokes on
#	the same machine), the local path machine MUST be the first entry.
