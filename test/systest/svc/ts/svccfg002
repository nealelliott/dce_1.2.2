#
# purpose: Verifies use of DCE_SVC_ROUTING_FILE on server startup
#
# procedure:
#  for each DCE server
#  - edit /etc/rc.dce to set DCE_SVC_ROUTING_FILE to point to
#    component routing file before starting each server
#  - start each server in /etc/rc.dce
#  - Verify Log files were created upon successful startup of each server
#    and startup registered in NOTICE file
