# 	Transarc delta: mason-ot5976-defer-io-during-recovery 1.2
# 	  Selected comments:
# 	    The NBS changes meant that there could be many pages which didn't really n
# 	eed
# 	    I/O.  The existing simplistic algorithm was merrily reading and writing th
# 	ose
# 	    pages even though no data on the pages was modified.  To fix this, we mere
# 	ly
# 	    defer the I/O until we find a transaction really needing to write on the d
# 	ata
# 	    page; once found we keep it around.  At the end we check to see if we ever
# 	    read it.  If so, we write it back to disk. If not, we just go to the next
# 	    modified disk block.
# 	    This first delta is a checkpoint.
# 	    Complete work here.  This version completes the delta.  Add several
# 	    regression tests and enhance the testing language to support better
# 	    concurrency guarantees.
# 	    Test script for running recovery regression tests.

#
# NOTES:
#
#   This is a simple shell wrapper around a series of simple regression
#   tests used to verify that changes to recovery do not break the system.
#   The system itself is fragile - bad scripts can generate arbitrary core
#   dumps, and there are implicit assumptions within the code about the
#   multi-threadedness of the caller (e.g. it assumes many active trans
#   means it is OK to block waiting for another tran to end).  Writing new
#   scripts is doable, just don't be surprised if they are difficult to debug
#
#   This script assumes that there is an executable program called "testbuf"
#   in the current directory.  If it isn't here, create a symbolic link to
#   it or copy it to here.
#
