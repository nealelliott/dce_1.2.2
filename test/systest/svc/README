RUNNING the TESTS
=================
NOTE: Must be run as root!

  First make sure you have installed and configged the
  tests using dcetest_config.

  To run the SVC tests, first su to root.  Then source
  the /dcetest/dcelocal/test/tet/system/profile.dcest.tet
  file from your k-shell.  Then invoke the svc test driver, 
  run.svc, indicating the number of iterations to run and 
  the desired test(s).  For example:

% su
# ksh
# . /dcetest/dcelocal/test/tet/system/profile.dcest.tet
# run.svc -l 1  svccfg001   # run just svccfg001 test for 1 loop
# run.svc -l 1  all   	    # run all svc tests for 1 loop

  Each test, svccfg00[1-6], takes approximately 10 minutes to 
  run through 1 iteration.  Most of this time is due to long
  'sleeps' inserted before restarting the DCE daemons.  As the
  tests are executing, you may observe the partial results of
  the run by doing a 'tail -f' on the file 'tet_xres' in the
  /dcetest/dcelocal/test/tet/system/svc/ts/ directory.  This
  file eventually gets moved into the 'journal' file at the end
  of the test.


SERVICEABILITY TESTS
====================

Test Name: SVCCFG001
Purpose:   Verifies use of default routing file on server startup
Procedure:
  - Bring down each server using dce.clean
  - edit /etc/rc.dce to copy component routing file
    into default routing file before starting each server
  - Run /etc/rc.dce to restart servers
  - Verify Log files were created upon successful startup of each server
    and startup registered in NOTICE file

Test Name: SVCCFG002 
Purpose:   Verifies use of DCE_SVC_ROUTING_FILE on server startup
Procedure:
  - Bring down each server using dce.clean
  - edit /etc/rc.dce to set DCE_SVC_ROUTING_FILE to point to
    component routing file before starting each server
  - Verify Log files were created upon successful startup of each server
    and startup registered in NOTICE file


Test Name: SVCCFG003 
Purpose:   Verifies user of -w flag on server startup
Procedure:
  - Bring down each server using dce.clean
  - edit /etc/rc.dce to start each server with -w switch specifying
    routing of (at least) NOTICE messages
  - Verify Log files were created upon successful startup of each server
    and startup registered in NOTICE file

Test Name: SVCCFG004 
Purpose:   Verifies use SVC_<severity> on server startup
Procedure:
  - Bring down each server using dce.clean
  - edit /etc/rc.dce to precede start of each server with specifying
    SVC_<severity> message routing
  - Verify Log files were created upon successful startup of each server
    and startup registered in NOTICE file

Test Name: SVCCFG005 
Purpose:   Verifies use of SVC_<component>_DBG on server startup
Procedure:
  - Bring down each server using dce.clean
  - edit /etc/rc.dce to precede start of each server with specifying
    specifying lowest dbg level
  - Verify Debug files were created upon successful startup of each server

Test Name: SVCCFG006 
Purpose:   Verifies use of debug level in default routing file on server startup
Procedure:
  - Bring down each server using dce.clean
  - edit /etc/rc.dce to copy component routing file containing debug specs
    into default routing file before starting each server
  - Verify Debug files were created upon successful startup of each server
