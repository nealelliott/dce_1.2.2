Details for sec_salvage_db testing

    On DCE 1.2.2 `sec_salvage_db' can manipulate the registry database which
    contains the foreign principal name as group member.
    Verify its enhanced specification by just using -print and -reconstruct
    options.  Details are in ATTACH 1.

    The basic procedures are:
    (1) modify Database by global principal operations
    (2) shutdown secd
    (3) do sec_salvage_db -print to dump Database to print files
    (4) verify if global principal operation is reflected in print files
    (5) do sec_salvage_db -reconstruct to restore previous Database's
        contents
    (6) re-run secd

GLOBALGROUP TEST SCENARIO (sec_salvage_db testing)

1. Prerequisites

    We need two DCE cells in this test.

	cL	local cell (cell on the local host)
	cR	remote cell (cell on the remote host)


2. Test Scenario
2.1 Setting up test condition

    Create a group and an account into the local cell like bellow;

	dcecp> group create gG
	dcecp> principal create pL
	dcecp> account create pL -group none -organization none

	- gG means a group object which will include foreign principals
	- pL means a principal object which belongs to the local cell

    Create some accounts into the remote cell like bellow;

	dcecp> principal create pR
	dcecp> principal create pRs
	dcecp> principal create pRl
	dcecp> account create pR -group none -organization none
	dcecp> account create pRs -group none -organization none
	dcecp> account create pRl -group none -organization none

	- pR means a principal object which belongs to the remote cell
	- pRs means a principal object which belongs to the remote cell, and
	  has a short enough principal name (minimal length of principal name)
	- pRl means a principal object which belongs to the remote cell, and
	  has a long enough principal name (maximal length of principal name)

    After this operation, enable the cells to show each name space using
    "dcecp cdscache create", and connect to remote cell using
    "dcecp registry connect".


2.2 Details for testing

    Modify Database by adding or removing global principals, then verify
    if the group which has the global principals as member is re-constructed
    correctly.

(1) login to the cell cL as a cell_admin

	dce_login cell_admin

(2) add the principals as members of the group gG

	dcecp -c group add gG -member /.../cR/pR /.../cR/pRl /.../cR/pRs pL

(3) verify that group gG has members above

	dcecp> group list gG
	/.../cR/pR
	/.../cR/pRl
	/.../cR/pRs
	/.../cL/pL
	dcecp>

(4) stop the master replica server using `dcecp registry stop' command

	dcecp> registry stop /.:/sec/master

(5) cleanup the login context and associated credentials

	kdestroy

(6) dump the database to print files using `sec_salvage_db -print' command

	sec_salvage_db -print

(7) verify if the global group information is in the print files correctly

	vi ./rgy_print/group.prt

(8) re-construct the database from the print files using `sec_salvage_db -reconstruct' command

	sec_salvage_db -reconstruct

(9) reinitialize the registry database using `secd -restore_master' command

	secd -restore_master

(10) login to the cell cL as a cell_admin

	dce_login cell_admin

(11) verify that group gG has members seen in (3) above

	dcecp> group list gG
	/.../cR/pR
	/.../cR/pRl
	/.../cR/pRs
	/.../cL/pL
	dcecp>

(12) remove the principals from the membership list of the group gG

	dcecp -c group remove gG -member /.../cR/pR /.../cR/pRl /.../cR/pRs pL

(13) verify that group gG has no members

	dcecp> group list gG
	dcecp>

(14) stop the master replica server by using `dcecp registry stop' command

	dcecp> registry stop /.:/sec/master

(15) cleanup the login context and associated credentials

	kdestroy

(16) dump the database to print files by using `sec_salvage_db -print' command

	sec_salvage_db -print

(17) verify if the global group information is in the print files correctly

	vi ./rgy_print/group.prt

(18) re-construct the database from the print files by using `sec_salvage_db -reconstruct' command

	sec_salvage_db -reconstruct

(19) reinitialize the registry database by using `secd -restore_master' command

	secd -restore_master

(20) login to the cell cL as a cell_admin

	dce_login cell_admin

(21) verify that group gG has no members seen in (13) above

	dcecp> group list gG
	dcecp>
