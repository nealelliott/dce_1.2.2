This directory contains a set of tests for the upserver and upclient.
The upserver is the distributor of a set of files/directories
specified on its command line.  The upclient process periodically
queries the upserver for updates in a set of files/directories
specified on its command line to see if any updates have been made.
If the desired files have changed, the upclient grabs the new files.

The biggest problem with this test is the amount of time it takes to
run, which is 28 minutes on a RIOS.  The reason it takes so long is
that the servers are apparently very slow in starting.  Other
architectures may require longer waits to make sure the programs have
enough time to get going that the test is valid.

The test suite is made up of 4 tests:

1) Upserver exporting a directory and upclient importing the same
directory.  The test writes a file into the directory, waits, then
makes sure the file appears on the client.  (If the servers are not
given enough time to start up, the file will not appear in time and
the test will fail.)

2) Upserver exporting a directory and upclient importing a different
one.  The test writes a file into the directory, waits (longer), and
makes sure that the file does NOT appear.

3) Upserver exporting a directory and upclient importing a file in
that directory.  The test writes 2 files into the directory, waits,
then checks to see that only the file being imported appears on the
client. 

4) Upserver exporting a file and upclient importing same file.  This
is the same test as 1) except that it uses files instead of
directories.

Sample output:

Administrivia:

You have to run this test on a cell with two DFS servers and you must
run it as either root or cell_admin.  It will use the current machine
as the server and will pick another to be the client.  The test will
shutdown any upserver/upclient already running on the machines and
will restart then after.
