# 	Transarc delta: ota-db3432-cleanup-badblocks-scanning 1.4
# 	  Selected comments:
# 	    Move the scan bad blocks file processing code to aggregate.c where it
# 	    can be near the make bad blocks file code used by newaggr.  This also
# 	    means we call it during salvage directly after verifying the badblock
# 	    anode, which we do explicitly (not part of the general traverse) anyway.
# 	    This change uncovered a bug in the existing make bad block file code
# 	    which left the unused portion of the badblock frame zeroed.
# 	    Add another create_aggregate with exceptions command.  This verifies
# 	    that the new bad block writing code works.
# 	    In the above changes I also put "#if !defined(KERNEL)" around most of
# 	    the aggregate creation code.  An unexpect result was that AVL_INDEX
# 	    wasn't defined any more for use inside the kernel.
# 	    Set ss->volIx and ss->anodeIx during bad block scan so error messages
# 	    are reported properly.
# 	    Don't return an uninitialized code variable from BitmapSetup if there is
# 	    no bad block index listed in the superblock.
