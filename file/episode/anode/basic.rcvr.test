# 	Transarc delta: ota-ot7000-improve-comments 1.4
# 	  Selected comments:
# 	    I have been updating the anode layer specs.  There have been many cases
# 	    where the corresponding source file comment is lacking descriptions that
# 	    are in the spec, where the spec is missing useful text present in the
# 	    source comments, and where the source comments are missing entirely.  I
# 	    have been updating the source comments to be near verbatim copies of the
# 	    description in the spec.  This includes TeXisms which I hope readers of
# 	    the source will forgive.
# 	    STATUS: As of r1.4  FINISHED.
# 	    Just change the script name from "basic" to "basic.rcvr".
# 	    More comments.
# 	    Update some Copyrights.
# 	    Final changes.  These now match the dspec document that is checked in
# 	    for dfs-102.
