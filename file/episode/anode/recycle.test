# recycle -- cause copious anode handle recycling while also encouraging the
#     formation of very large ECs.  While this is going on write some data into
#     a file.  Wait awhile until the anode handle is recycled but not so long
#     that the transaction used to write the data can complete.  Then create a
#     COW clone of that file.  This will not join the EC but will reference the
#     blocks allocated by the write.  Use fsync to commit the transaction used
#     for the COW create.  An abort will cause recovery to undo the writes.
#     The salvager will detect errors because the COW file refers to
#     unallocated blocks and related problems.
#
#     Because of large logs the freed block list can tie up a lot of disk
#     space.  This script ran too close to the edge at 600 blocks and got
#     intermittent aggregate full errors.  Increase to 700.  (db4810)
