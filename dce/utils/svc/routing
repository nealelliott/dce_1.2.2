## This is a prototype DCE serviceability routing file.
## Leading whitespace is ignored, as are lines whose first non-whitespace
## character is a #.  As installed, all lines in this file are commented
## out.  If the DCE_SVC_ROUTING_FILE environment variable is set, it names
## this file; the value is file is /opt/dcelocal/var/svc/routing.
## (It is not an error if DCE_SVC_ROUTING_FILE points to a non-existant file.)

## This file is consulted if no switch were given on the command-line, or
## if no environment variable (SVC_level or SVC_comp_DBG) could be found.

## Production messages are parsed as:
##	level:where:parameter
## level is FATAL ERROR WARNING NOTICE NOTICE_VERBOSE or * meaning all.
## where is STDERR STDOUT FILE (or TEXTFILE) BINFILE DISCARD
## parameter is the filename where "%ld" becomes the process-id.
## To send all notices to the console, then:
#*:FILE:/dev/console

## If FILE or BINFILE ends with ".n.m" then at most "n" files of "m" entries
## each will be written where ".n" will be appended to each generation of
## file.  So to keep the last 1000 warnings around in 10 files for all
## programs:
#NOTICE:FILE.10.100:/var/log/syslog

## Debug messages are parsed as:
##	comp:level,level,level:where:parameter
## comp is the component (rpc, dts, sec, etc)
## level is a list of sub-component levels for each component
## where and parameter are as above.
## It is hard to know the comp and level without access to, say, the sams
## Levels are subcomp.n, where n is 1 to 9.  They are parsed in order so
## put sub-component wildcard entries first.

## So DTS tracing might be:
#dts:*.1,arith.9:STDERR:
## Which sets low-level debugging of everything, and then full debugging
## for the math part.

## Each component can have its own entry so to turn on parts of RPC use
## something like the following:
#rpc:cnauth.9,cnpkt.4:STDOUT:

## A component cannot be named twice -- component debug messages all go
## into one place.

FATAL:STDERR:-;FILE:/opt/dcelocal/var/svc/fatal.log
ERROR:STDERR:-;FILE:/opt/dcelocal/var/svc/error.log
WARNING:STDERR:-;FILE:/opt/dcelocal/var/svc/warning.log
