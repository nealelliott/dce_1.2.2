This directory contains various tools to help diagnose DFS problems.

strip_dump.c -- reads from STDIN a "DFS backup dump" of a fileset and
    strips all backup information from the file. The resulting data is
    send to STDOUT and should contain a fts restorable fileset dump.

display_fset.pl -- displays a DFS fileset dump.  The file data is
    discarded but (most of) the fileset and vnode metadata is printed to
    STDOUT.

Pointers to other useful goodies:

file/episode/scavenge/epidump -- useful for examining an Episode disk by
    reading the raw disk device.

admin/dfscheck/dfscheck -- dumps various kernel databases using /dev/mem.
