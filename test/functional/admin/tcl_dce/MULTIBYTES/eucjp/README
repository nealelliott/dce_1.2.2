  This directory contains multi-bytes functional tests for Japanese EUC 
encoding.  These functional tests do not cover all the functionality
the original Tcl provides. 

  Due to the time and resource restraint, the current Tcl I18N implementation
is not tested sufficiently.  It is verified that the multi-byte string parsing 
works correctly with the characters which contain the Tcl special characters
such as '[', however.

  It is recommended that the users of the internationalized Tcl will write
additional functional tests by using the multi-byte characters used for these 
functional tests.  This is especially true for SJIS encoding.

How to run the tests.

  1) Set the current locale to Japanese EUC, by setting 'LANG' environment
     variable to the Japanese EUC locale.

  2) Execute 'tclsh'.

  3) 'source' each functional test from the tclsh.  For example,

    % source append.test

  4) Verify the result.  For example, if the test succeed, the following
     messages will appear.

    % source append.test
    ++++ append1 PASSED
    ++++ append2 PASSED
    ++++ append3 PASSED
    ++++ append4 PASSED
