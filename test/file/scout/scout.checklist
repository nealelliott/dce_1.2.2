Scout test coverage

The only tests that are present now are one to test the command line options by
giving invalid values to each of the options, and another to start up scout 
with valid values and see the resulting display.

New tests -

1. Scout command line testing
   - valid/invalid values for each of scout's options.
   - test values for
     conn  - increase/decrease client connections to the file server.
     fetch - do copies out from file server.
     store - do copies in to file server.
     ws    - wait for 15 min.(this wait decrements 'ws' value by 1), check 
	     this value, then client calls server( incrementing 'ws' by 1).
     disk  - Increase/Decrease data on each aggregate monitored and not change
	     on each probe.

2. While entering values for each of the above parameters, set threshold values
   low enough so that we could exceed these limits easily. This would cause
   these values to be displayed in reverse video. This may be hard to test
   in a script but could be made by visual examination by the tester.

3. Try fast probes for a long period to detect resource exhaustions.

4. Scout should be able to reset terminal settings upon exit. Check this.
