                        DCE Sample Applications


This directory contains the source code for several DCE example applications.
It contains the following subdirectories:


   demo:   contains source for three DCE example applications new for DCE 1.1;
           see the READMEs in the

               demo/context_app
               demo/data_test_app
               demo/generic_app

           subdirectories for details on these programs.


   svc:    contains source for two Serviceability test/demo programs; see the
           READMEs in the

               svc/timop_svc

           and

               svc/hello_svc

           subdirectories for details on these programs.


   timop:  contains source for the original DCE example application "timop",
           which in previous versions of DCE was located at:

               <dce-root-dir>/dce/src/test/sample

           The contents of timop have not changed; they have only been moved
           to

               <dce-root-dir>/dce/src/examples/timop

           for DCE 1.1. For further information about the program, see the
           README in the directory.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note that none of these examples are automatically built or installed with DCE; instead,
all files are copied to:

    <dce-root-dir>/dce/install/<platform>/opt/dce1.1/usr/examples

if "build install_all" is executed manually at this level. Generic (non-ODE) Makefiles
are supplied which you can then use to build the executables, as described in the
accompanying READMEs.
