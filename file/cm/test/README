The scripts and programs in this directory exist for testing parts of the
cache manager and server preferences.  Generate_prefs and test_preflock
are perl scripts. You will need perl 4.0 or later, available by anonymous
ftp from, for example, ftp.uunet.com. Perl is part of the GNU software
distribution.

Cm_preftest is a unit test that can be used to exercise in user space the
cache manager server structure routines including server preferences.  To
use this, first runs generate_prefs to make a database file for the
current host.  Then run cm_preftest over that database file.  Note that
the local host IP address affects default preferences, so you must use the
database file generated for the same host as the one running cm_preftest.

Test_preflock is used in a working cell with a replicated fileset.  The
object is to change server preferences dynamically while accessing a
fileset that is subject to these preferences.  When the cache manager
looks for data from the fileset, it should appear to move from server to
server as the preferences change.
