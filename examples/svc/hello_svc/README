		DCE Sample Application "hello_svc"


The hello_svc program is a very simple demo/test of the DCE Serviceability API.
When executed, it does nothing more than print a "Hello world" message to 
standard error via the serviceability interface.

The program was developed during the writing of the OSF DCE Application Devel-
opment Guide chapter on Serviceability, and is included in the DCE 1.1 Beta
release as a very simple demo of the interface.

hello_svc is not automatically built with DCE; instead, you can install its
files to

  <dce-root-dir>/dce/install/<platform>/opt/dce1.1/usr/examples/svc/hello_svc

by executing "build install_all" (an ODE command) in the top-level examples
directory

    <dce-root-dir>/dce/src/examples

(to install all the examples) or in the

    <dce-root-dir>/dce/src/examples/svc/hello_svc

directory (to install hello_svc alone).

For more information about ODE (the OSF Development Environment), see Chapter
12 of the OSF DCE Porting and Testing Guide.

A generic (non-ODE) Makefile is supplied which you can then use to build the
executable, as follows:

    make -f Makefile_hello_svc

Once you have built hello_svc, execute it by typing

    hello_svc

with no arguments. You should see two messages similar to the following:

    1994-06-10-13:07:33.628+00:00I----- ./hello_svc NOTICE hel main 0xa448c444
    Hello world
    1994-06-10-13:07:33.628+00:00I----- ./hello_svc NOTICE hel main 0xa448c444
    Hello world

(The message is printed twice because it is routed to standard error twice:
once via a call to dce_svc_routing() within the program, and also by the
"attributes" field in the message definition in the hel.sams file.)

For more information on Serviceability functionality, see Chapter 4, "Using
the DCE Serviceability Application Interface" in the OSF DCE Application
Development Guide -- Core Components volume. See also the log.8dce (the
dcecp log object, through which the DCE components' serviceability routes
and settings are managed) reference page in the OSF DCE Command Reference.
