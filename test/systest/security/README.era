EXTENDED REGISTRY ATTRIBUTES TESTS
==================================

  Two existing tests have been updated to test the 
  Extended Registry Attribute (ERA) functionality.
  The tests are identified in the System Test Plan
  as ERAREL001 and ERAOBJ001.  Both tests were
  implemented by adding the optional USE_ERA flag
  to the dcesestr and dceseacl tests, respectively.
  However, they are invoked by their own name, i.e.
  erarel001 and eraobj001.


INSTALLING the TESTS
====================
% build install_all
% dcetest_config 

RUNNING the TESTS
=================
% ksh
% cd /dcetest/dcelocal/test/tet/system
% . ./profile.dcest.tet
% run.sec -l 1 -m <machine-name> erarel001
% run.sec -l 1 -m <machine-name> eraobj001


TEST DESCRIPTIONS
=================
Test Name: ERAREL001
Purpose:   Verify that accounts work reliably with ERAs 
	   added to the principals
Procedure:
This is the procedure of the current dcesestr test with ERA added.
  - Add ERA schema entries to the registry for desired attributes.
  - Add a number (default = 10) of PGOs with ERAs to registry.
  - Add valid accounts based on PGOs
  - Add invalid accounts based on PGOs
  - On each machine specified in test run:
     = For each valid account created:
	- Login to new valid account
	- Change home directory, shell, and password on account and 
	  verify each change
	- Change values of ERAs on account and verify change
     = For each invalid account created:
	- Attempt login to invalid accounts, verify failure
     = For each valid account created:
	- Login to new valid account again
	- Change home directory, shell, and password back to original 
	  values and verify change
	- Change ERAs back to original values
  - Delete all registry objects (including ERAs and schema)

Test Name: ERAOBJ001
Purpose:   Verify that accounts with ERAs added to the principals are
	   properly granted/denied access to objects based on ACLs.
Procedure:
This is the procedure of the current dceseacl test with ERA added.
  - Add ERA schema to registry
  - Add PGO, and corresponding admin account 
  - Use acl_edit to set permissions for acct to change ACLs on 
    registry objects (including the attr_schema object).
  - Add ERA schema entries to the registry for desired attributes.
