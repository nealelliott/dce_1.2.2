This test has a dual purpose to test out the user_delegate ACL entry type.
and to test out the delegation compatibility modes.
In other words this single test comprises the two system
tests dlgcfg002 and dlgcmp001

dts_client is an initiator which calls dts_intermediary
dts_intermediary is a delegate which calls sec_acl_test_access.

dts_intermediary will do a sec_acl_test_access check
on a DTS ACL (e.g.  /.:/hosts/stthomas/dts-entity)


Setup (for user_delegate ACL entry type testing, a.ka. dglcfg002):

1) build and install the program
   or cd to install/at386/dcetest/dce1.1/test/tet/system/security/dlgcfg002

2) dce_login as cell_admin and run dts_rgy_setup.sh script to add registry items

3) dce_login as cell_admin and
   start "dts_intermediary -h hostname -all -d"  
   where hostname is the hostname where the ACL resides


4) Adjust the acl on /.:/hosts/stthomas/dts-entity with commands like
   the following (assuming there is a dts-entity on stthomas): 

acl_edit /.:/hosts/stthomas/dts-entity -m user:dts_test: -m user_delegate:dts_svr:
acl_edit /.:/hosts/stthomas/dts-entity -m user:dts_test:rwc -m user_delegate:dts_svr:rwc


5) dce_login as cell_admin and run dts_client

You should expect either: 

PASSED: Delegation test


or

FAILED: Delegation test; Error from dts_test_access:


Note: A major drawback of this test is it only test 1 delegation
      ACL entry type.  The test can be improved by adding
      more ACL entry types.

      Also this test uses cached name service database bindings.
      So, if you run the test from a certain node, you can not
      then change the node you want to run the test from.
      To fix this you need to use rpc_ns_mgmt_set_exp_age
      in the client part of the test.

Setup (for delegation compatibility testing, a.k.a dlgcmp001):

1) build and install the program
   or cd to install/at386/dcetest/dce1.1/test/tet/system/security/dlgcfg002

2) dce_login as cell_admin and run dts_rgy_setup.sh script to add registry items

3) dce_login as cell_admin and
   start "dts_intermediary -h hostname -all -d"  on 1.1 machine
   where hostname is the hostname where the ACL resides


4) Adjust the acl on /.:/hosts/stthomas/dts-entity with commands like
   the following (assuming the pre1.1 machine was stthomas): 

acl_edit /.:/hosts/stthomas/dts-entity -m user:dts_test: -m user:dts_svr:
acl_edit /.:/hosts/stthomas/dts-entity -m user:dts_test:rwc -m user:dts_svr:rwc


5) dce_login as cell_admin and run dts_client

You should expect either: 

PASSED: Delegation test


or

FAILED: Delegation test; Error from dts_test_access:
