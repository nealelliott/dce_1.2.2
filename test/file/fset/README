The "runall" script is a wrapper fro a higher level script that
runs these tests without user intervention. The "runall" script
checks for required resources, manages the resources appropriately
and collects the test log.

The default aggregate is epi0. Edit runall to use a different
aggregate.

OVERVIEW

This directory contains the fileset ("ftutil") test tools for testing
DCE LFS fileset operations.  The ITL interpreter, fset_test, that is
built in this directory provides an interface that allows the tester
to make both traditional filesystem calls (open, close, read, write,
etc.) as well as calls to the ftutil library routines.  These
routines are used by the ftserver to do all of its fileset manipulation, so
tests can be written using this facility that test the ftserver code paths
without requiring full-blown DCE/DFS.  Only the DFS core and LFS kernel
modules are necessary.

The existing tests in the "scripts" subdirectory concentrate on
ensuring that the clone related operations work in the face of
existing references to files in the affected filesets.  Various
existing test_anode scripts should ensure that the basic clone
operations work for various sizes and types of files.

Another set of tests, those run by the "bomb.itl" script, ensure that we can
recover from failures/crashes during clone, unclone/destroy, and reclone.

RUNNING THE TESTS

From this directory:

1. Make sure the following resources exist on the test machine:
	a. A partition named "/dev/epi0"
	b. Two unused directories named "/mnt" and "/mnt2"
   See the section below on customization for information on
   overriding these names.
2. Make sure that your path includes the following executables:
	newaggr, salvage, epimount, and epiunmount
   and the fset test driver binary fset_test
3. Issue the following command:
	../../../../obj/rios/test/file/fset/fset_test -I scripts/all_tests.itl

Since these tests will be put under TET in the near future, this
procedure remains less than polished.

CUSTOMIZATION

The file "scripts/defaults.itl" contains all of the ITL variable
settings for things that can be customized.  In most cases there is a
corresponding environment variable that can be set to override the
default.  See that file for more details.
