# 	Transarc delta: ota-ot5926-AFS-quota 1.7
# 	  Selected comments:
# 	    Motivation:
# 	    This delta augments Episode to maintain two types of size
# 	    information about filesets and their constituent anodes.  Further,
# 	    independent limits are omposed for each size measures.  The two
# 	    measures are called allocated and visible.  The first matches the
# 	    old semantics and counts fragments actually allocated to the anode
# 	    or fileset.  The second (new) measure counts fragments visible in an
# 	    anode or fileset.  The principle difference appears when COW is
# 	    being used.  A freshly cloned anode will have zero allocated size
# 	    but visible size which is the same as that for its backing anode.
# 	    Similarly deleting a large file which was just clones will not
# 	    reduce the allocated usage of the containing fileset but will return
# 	    the expected amount of space to the visible usage, even if not
# 	    blocks were actually freed in the underlying aggregate.
# 	    Details of the implementation strategy are in:
# 	    ~ota/doc/episode/FilesetQuota.text.
# 	    Status:
# 	    This delta is restricted to Episode only changes.  The corresponding
# 	    changes in the fileset layers (including ftutil, ftserver, and the
# 	    fts command, not to mention the doc changes) are in other OTs and
# 	    deltas.
# 	    This script tries a long sequence of writes and truncates with randomly
# 	    selected offsets.  Mixed in are creates of COW files which are also
# 	    randomly written and truncated.
# 	    Introduced a bug in recloning an already recloned fragmented fileset.
# 	    This was exposed by the fts tests.
# 	    Fix several problems that turned up when running the fts tests.
# 	    All_tests was failing on multi-block-frag.int.test.  The cause was a
# 	    confusion of the calling conventions of MoveUnblockedAnodes; it can be
# 	    called with the backing container BLOCKED, with the visible field not
# 	    yet updated.
# 	    A typo augmented by liberal cut-and-paste caused several volume quota
# 	    updates to be done with a transaction id of zero (and therefore not
# 	    logged).  This lead to errors after recovery.
# 	    Found several salvage problems while tracking down another problem.  But
# 	    since the afflicted code had been modified in this delta, I thought it
# 	    would be reduce the risk of merge conflicts to make the change as part
# 	    of this delta.
# 	    Changing the IsAnodeAllEmpty predicate to use the visible field is a
# 	    great efficiency win but the salvager gets really unhappy when it tries
# 	    to read in directories with a zero visible field (i.e. running on
# 	    -verify on an old aggregate).
# 	    For now, for upward compatibility, go back to the old scheme.

# truncate.int -- creates a file and fills it with randomly located bytes.
#     The leads to very sparse files.  Periodically a COW copy of this
#     file is created and truncated to another random offset, then
#     deleted.  This process continues.  There are two sequences, one
#     with 100 uniformly distributed offsets on the range [0..2^32) and
#     the second 100 exponentially distributed over the same range (i.e.
#     the offset is 2^x, with 'x' uniformly distributed on the range
#     [0..32).)  The third sequence does more truncates and modifies the COW
#     file as well.

truncate.int 1

# First, try uniformly distributed random numbers.
