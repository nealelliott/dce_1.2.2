README file for DFS test/file/os_calls/scripts/stress moving* tests.


The moving*.itl scripts test fileset moves under stressful conditions.
To run these tests requires the following.

*)  Check the appropriate .config file (named same as test script) to
    validate the configuration variables.  You should also check any
    files they include.  Currently those are common_dist.config and
    moving_common.config.

*)  You must set the environment variable DFS_TESTINSTALL to the top of
    the DFS test install tree.  For example,

	setenv DFS_TESTINSTALL /dce/install/rios/dcetest/dce1.0/test/file
