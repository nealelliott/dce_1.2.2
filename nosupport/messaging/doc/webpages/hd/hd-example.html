We believe that several working application examples or demos will prove
valuable for several reasons.
First, concrete examples help us better explain the uses and features of the
messaging and queuing system.
Second, working application code will give us a programmers perspective of our
code.
We will be better able to see what is awkward or missing.
Third, exercising our code in applications will serve as a
quality assurance measure.

<DL>
  <DT> "zephyr"
  <DD> A message delivery system similar to MIT's Project Athena
	<EM>zephyr</EM> would prove useful within a small organization, such
	as ours.
	Here simple textual message are passed from one user's workstation
	to anothers, where the message pops up on the recipient's screen
	in a small window.
	In this example, the senders and recipients are typically low-end
	machines, acting as peers - the size and types of messages passing
	each way is the same.

  <DT> bank
  <DD> A primitive banking example will show deposits, withdraws, and queries.
	Both "customers" and bank "employees" will have the correct access
	to information.
	In this example, the "client" may typically be a low-end machine
	- we can think of it as an ATM - while the machine providing the
	account service is a large machine.
	This will exercise several features of the queue manager,
	such as time-to-receive, which can be used for sending messages for
	deposits to accounts (eg, weekly payroll) early in the week to be
	credited (actually delivered) on Friday.
