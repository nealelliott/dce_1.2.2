# Checks to make sure that dir id 1 is configured, and if not, 
# configures it.  The check is for a cache file for dir id 1; since the
# dir id can't be deconfigured, this should indicate the directory system
# has been configured.  If it is configured, then we change the configuration
# to what we want.  This is a bit heavy-handed, and possibly should be made
# a bit more intelligent in the future; ie: check to see if dir id one is
# running okay, and do nothing if it is.

echo "gdssysadm -fd -p"
gdssysadm -fd -p

#
# If the cache file for dir id 1 exists, then mod the directory, else, 
# configure it.
