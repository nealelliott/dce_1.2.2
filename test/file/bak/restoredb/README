#    This the first pass at automating tests for the bak restoredb command.  They
# work with expect-4.3.  They will need to be updated to work with expect,
# version 5.
#
# Initial checkin.

   The numbering of the restoredb tests in this directory agree with the
numbering of the bak checklist
(/afs/transarc.com/project/fs/dev/dfs/test/dfs/doc/checklist/bak.checklist).
The pertinent portion of that file is presented below.  Asterisks(*) denote
tests and preceeding dashes(-) indicate tests that are not implemented yet.

restoredb
        Synopsis:
                 restore bak database from tape
        Syntax:
                 restoredb  [-tcid <TC number>] [-help]
        BASIC:
         *1b    - no options
          2b    - with the -tcid option
         *2.1b    - tcid = 0
         *2.2b    - tcid = 1
         *2.3b    - tcid = 1023
        ERROR:
          1e    - no options
        -*1.1e    - invalid (or missing) tape label
        -*1.2e    - valid tape label but invalid tape contents
        -*1.3e    - no tape controller at offset 0
        -*1.4e    - backup database not removed
                    (I don't know what the correct behavior should be)
          2e    - with -tcid option
          2.1e    - no tape controller at this tcid
         *2.1.1e    - not in db
         *2.1.2e    - in db but not active
         *2.2e    - tcid < 0
         *2.3e    - tcid > 1023
