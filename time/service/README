DCE time servers are designed to synchronize their system clocks with 
time provided by external sources.  Four sample external time-provider 
interface programs are provided:

	dtss_acts_provider - dials the National Institute of
		Standard and Time using a Scholar Plus modem to obtain
		the current Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)

	dtss_spectracom_provider - obtains the UTC via a
		Spectracom radio clock device

	dtss_traconex_provider - obtains the UTC via a Traconex 
		radio clock device

	dtss_ntp_provider - obtains the UTC from a Network Time
		Protocol (NTP) server


The modem and NTP time provider programs use the RPC-based time-provider
interface.


To build all of the time-providers supplied in this directory, type:

	make -f Makefile.tp

dts_acts_provider can be compiled for modems that use the AT command
set (e.g. Hayes) by defining the _HAYES symbol and for PBX environments
that require dialing "9" before the outside number by defining _PBX.

To start and use a time-provider, type the name of the time-provider program.
For example, to start the time-provider for NTP, type:

	./dtss_ntp_provider
