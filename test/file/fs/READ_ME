# 	  Selected comments:
# 	    To remove make, clean options from fs tests
# 	    Really no change
# 	    Make the scripts modular, structured.
# 	    The variable names are changed to follow coding standards.
# 	    Apply modification mentioned in revision 1.2 to 2 missed test file
# 	    err1 and err2.
# 	    Some bug fixes, and revision of tests err1 and err2. Introduction of
# 	    a common functions ProcessResult to analyse the result.
# 	    Further changes to some utility functions.
# 	    Added error test err2 to the Makefile

# 	  Selected comments:
# 	    Created this delta to merge Phil Hirsch's final DFS test code changes with
# 	    the test code that the OSF had.  Hopefully, this means we and the OSF
# 	    should be looking at the same test code.
# 	    Changes to facilitate merge of local DFS test code with the OSF's.

           The following Unix filesystem tests are in this directory
           ---------------------------------------------------------

err1   * Tests many invalid-operation error conditions
         Usage is:   sh -i err1

err2   * Tests many bad-permissions error conditions
         Usage is:   sh -i err2

test1    Multiple processes writing to the same file at the same time
         Usage is:   test1 [-np #-procs] [-nt #-times] [-f filename] [-base nr]
                           [make|clean]

test2    Multiple processes doing file operations in different directories
         Usage is:   test2 [-np #-procs] [-nt #-times] [-p directory-prefix]

test2b   Multiple processes doing big file operations in different directories
         Usage is:   test2b [-np #-procs] [-nt #-times] [-p directory-prefix]

test2s   Multiple processes doing file operations in the same directories
         Usage is:   test2s [-np #-procs] [-nt #-times]

test3    Creates many files and directories
         Usage is:   test3 [-small|-normal|-large]

test4    Repeatedly creates 16K and 256K files
         Usage is:   test4 [-np #-procs] [-nt #-times]

test5    Read throughput test
         Usage is:   test5 make|run|clean

test6    Unlink-an-open-file test
         Usage is:   test6

test7    Repeatedly creates, copies, and deletes a directory tree
         Usage is:   test7 [-nt #-times] [-nd #-dirs] [-nf #-16K-files]
         Note that -nd 4 -nf 16 uses roughly 2 megabytes of disk space

test8  * Does filesystem-to-filesystem operations
         Usage is:   test8 [-from dirname] [-to dirname] [-nomvdir]

test9  * Copies a large file from directory to directory
         Usage is:   test9 [-np #-procs] [-nt #-times] [-dir1 directory-name]
                           [-dir2 directory-name] [-size #-of-megabytes]
                           [-nocopy]

test10 * Performs operations in 2 supposedly equivalent directories
         Usage is:   test10 [-np #-procs] [-nt #-times] [-dir1 directory-name]
                            [-dir2 directory-name]

rtest1 * Change owner/group/mode test
         Usage is:   rtest1

The file "half_meg" is a symlink to a data file used in test5.
The short* and long* files are intended to be used in test1.
The rtest* tests must be run by root.
