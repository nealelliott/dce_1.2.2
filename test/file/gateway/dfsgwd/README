Overview:
---------
dfsgwd is a server that uses Kerberos5 to allow the remote creation/destruction
of DCE/Kerberos authentication tickets that are then used to establish/remove
credential mappings on the NFS Exporter. This is basically the
"remote" analog to the dfsgw add/delete command.

This directory contains the dfsgwd command test suite that exercises 
the dfsgwd funtionality.

Test Setup:
-----------
the test setup script add_dfsgwd.sh will perform the following needed
operations to run the dfsgwd funtional tests.

   1. add the dlog/udp server to the internet services database in
      the system's /etc/services 

   2. configure the dfs client machine to run a bosserver

   3. add a DCE registry account for dfsgwd server

the script rem_dfsgwd.sh will undo add_dfsgwd.sh
both scripts need to be run as cell_admin using the default dce passwd
  


Running the tests:
------------------
You must execute this test suite from the dfsgwd directory. To run the tests you
issue the command "runtests".

The test suite consists of test1 - dfsgwd help, test2 - dfsgwd server 
The results are logged in the dfsgwd directory file "dfsgwd.runtests.log"
