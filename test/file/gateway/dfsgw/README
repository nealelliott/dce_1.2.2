Overview:
---------

Dfsgw commands are issued by users and administrators to manipulate
(view/add/modify/destroy) the Authentication Table (AT) database that
manages associations between remote users at a particular host and a
DCE credential.  This directory contains the dfsgw command test suite
that exercises all dfsgw sub-commands.

Running the tests:
------------------

You must execute this test suite from the dfsgw directory. To run the
tests you issue the command "runtests".

The test suite consists of test1 - dfsgw help and apropos, test2 - dfsgw
add command, test3 dfsgw delete command, test4 dfsgw query command and
test5 dfsgw list command.

The results are logged in the dfsgw directory file "dfsgw.runtests.log"
