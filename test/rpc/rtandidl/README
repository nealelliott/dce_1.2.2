RTANDIDL Test Suite
============================================

This is the root of the the RTANDIDL test suite directory tree.

The control directory provides the necessary scripts to run these
tests. These scripts make use the of the executables from the directories
testsh and moretests to execute the tests.

Various control program scripts (filenames ending with .tsh) are provided
in the control directory. In reality a user can execute all the tests
by executing the following files:
	all_ns.tsh	- NSI tests
	all_runtime.tsh	- Binding, UUID, Object, DCE error inquire text tests
	all_idl.tsh	- IDL tests
	all_mgmt.tsh	- RPC Management tests
	all_auth.tsh	- RPC Authentication tests
	all_testdriver.tsh

All the tests need to be run from the control directory. The user can 
make use of the do_rpc_test script provided, to execute the above tests.
To use the 'do_rpc_test' script, the PROTOCOL environment variable must 
be set to the protocol sequence you wish to test: ncacn_ip_tcp or ncadg_ip_udp.
The do_rpc_test will take care of all other necessary settings. 
The user has to login as a privileged user (root) to execute the auth tests.

The syntax to use do_rpc_test (in the control directory):
	./do_rpc_test include_dir suite.tsh [debugging-level]

This script saves the results in the log file suite.tsh.log.

The user can chose the granularity of the test suite -
	all_runtime.tsh to execute all the tests described above or
	all_binding.tsh to execute just the binding tests.

Eg.:    do_rpc_test /usr/include all_ns.tsh

The alternate methods of executing the tests are provided in the
DCE Porting and Testing Guide.
