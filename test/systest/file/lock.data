# TITLE: lock.data
#
# ASSOCIATION:
#       This script is part of the DCE DFS system test suite.  The DCE
#       system test plan describes fully the goals of this test.
#
# SYNTAX:
# not executable - to be edited for any fileset available through
# dfs and used as the first argument to dfs.lock
#
# OBJECTIVE:
# To describe the clients of a dfs fileset, the level of stress desired
# (the higher the NUM* variables, the higher the stress), the
# principal to be used for file access, the sleep range, etc.
#
# DESCRIPTION:
# There should be one of these datafiles per dfs fileset.
#
# CALLED FROM: dfs.lock
