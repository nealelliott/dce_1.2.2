* 	Transarc delta: jdp-db3072-aggregate-interlocking 1.2
* 	  Selected comments:
* 	    This delta implements an interlocking feature that keeps
* 	    administrative commands like salvage and newaggr from stomping on an
* 	    attached (or mounted) fileset.  Two new primitives,
* 	    ftu_LockAggrDevice() and ftu_UnlockAggrDevice(), are provided by the
* 	    ftutil library and are used in both newaggr and salvage.
* 	    Two new test cases were added to the fset (ftutil) tests suite.  The first,
* 	    lock00.itl, tests the primitives directly. The second, lock01.itl, tests
* 	    interaction with newaggr and salvage for both attached aggregates and
* 	    mounted filesets.
* 	    Helper to allow lock attempts in a separate process.
* 	    Fix things up for OSF/1.
