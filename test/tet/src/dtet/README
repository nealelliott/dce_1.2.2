This is the Beta release of DTET.  It has been integrated with the ODE
environment.  The DTET specs and release notes reflect how to install
and build DTET when not integrated with ODE.  For information on using
DTET in the DME environment please refer to the DME release notes.

The rest of this README is based on the vanilla DTET and is not
relevant to using DTET with ODE.  All of the original Makefiles are
available in the tree as makefile.generic.

SCCS: @(#)README	1.1 (92/09/29)
DTET release 1.0b

All the makefiles include a file called defines.mk in this directory,
which should contain machine-specific definitions for your system.
If your system is one of those on which the DTET has already been tested,
a suitable defines.mk file can be found in the defines directory.
In this case, simply make a symbolic link named defines.mk to the appropriate
file.

For example, if your system is running Unix System V release 4, type

	ln -s defines/svr4.mk defines.mk

If your system's makefile definitions do not match any of the provided
examples, you will have to create your own defines.mk file.
You can either take a copy of one of the examples and modify it as required,
or use the template in defines/template.mk and build your own from scratch.

Once you have a suitable defines.mk file in place, you can compile the DTET.
To do this, simply type

	make

to compile the sources, or

	make install

to compile the sources and install the binaries in TET_ROOT/bin and
TET_ROOT/lib.
Refer to the DTET specification and DTET release notes for more details.
