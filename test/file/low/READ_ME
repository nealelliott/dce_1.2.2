           The following low-level C I/O tests are in this directory
           ---------------------------------------------------------

test1    Tests common low-level I/O ops on small and large files
         Usage is:   test1 make|run|clean

test2    B-tree database program
         Usage is:   test2 make|run|clean

test3    Tests read(), write(), and truncate()
         Usage is:   test3 [-np #-procs] [-nt #-times] [-s filesize] [-flush] 
         Here the filesize is in units of kilobytes (1024 bytes per kilobyte),
         and must be a multiple of 8.
	 -flush indicates that the buffer cache should be flushed between reads.

test4: * Ted's file_perf.c filesystem performance test
         Usage is:   test4 make|run|clean

test5:   Memory march test
         Usage is:   test5 make|run|clean

test6:   Directory test (create, traverse, delete)
         Usage is:   test6 [-np #-procs] [-nt #-times] [-nl #-levels] \
                           [-nf #-files] [-nd #-dirs] \
                           [make|clean]

test7:   Link test (hard links and symlinks)
         Usage is:   test7 [-np #-procs] [-nt #-times] \
                           [-nf #-files] [-nd #-dirs] [-nhl #-hard-links] \
                           [-nsl #-symlinks] [-nnsl #-non-existent-symlinks] \
                           [-nsf #-subdir-files] \
                           [make|clean]

test8:   Tests open() modes, creat(), dup(), rename(), fsync()
         Usage is:   test8 [-np #-procs] [-nt #-times] [-long] [make|clean]
         Each process spawns 3 subprocesses, so beware of using large numbers
            with the -np switch.

test9:   Tests calls to utime(), utimes, stat(), access(), chmod(), fchmod()
         Usage is:   test9 [-np #-procs] [-nt #-times] [make|clean]

test10:   Grows and shrinks a file repeatedly
          Usage is:   test10 [-np #-procs] [-nt #-times] [-s filesize] \
                             [make|clean]
          Note that the filesize is in bytes.

test11:   Tests file locking.
          Usage is:   test11 [make|run|clean]

test12    Tests scatter/gather read/write.
          Usage is:   test12 [make|run|clean]

test13  * Tests 2 processes accessing the same file via different paths
          Usage is:   test13 [-d1 dir1 -d2 dir2 | make | clean]

rtest1: * Test chroot() and fchroot() functions
          Usage is:   rtest1 make|run|clean

rtest2: * Test chown() and fchown() functions.
          Usage is:   rtest2 make|run|clean


Tests 2 and 4 are Transarc confidential. The rtest* tests will only succeed
if run by root.



The list_coverage script produces a coverage list.
The chk_errnr script checks a program's error messages.
The following files are used as data in various tests: 16_bytes, ctrl.asc,
    half_meg, styl.asc.
The locktest program is an interactive program, used to test file locking.
   Similarly, rwtest tests various general file I/O operations.
