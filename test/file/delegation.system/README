This test suite is adapted from Bryan Schmersal's system tests
for delegation.

Define the cell in cellconfig.data and also in cellconfig.sh (both
are necessary and must aggree with one another).

Note that these tests require that dced be run with the x-flag when
they are executed on Solaris platforms; on AIX run dced with the r
flag and execute dced_acl_patcher from the install tree before
running the tests. (We need this for the keytab files. After setup
it is OK to revert to the usual mode of running dced.)

The DFS files used by the tests must be located in LFS. The tester
is responsible for setting acls on all LFS objects leading to the
test directory (I make these acls as broad as possible), however the
test sets the acls on dir0 and file0.

I run these tests logged in as root and as cell_admin. I install the
tests somewhere in DFS. I save any pre-existing /.rhosts and
/etc/hosts.equiv files and replace them with versions that
have only a "+" on a line by itself. This must be done on every
machine to be used in the tests.
