To execute these tests under TET, follow the directions below.  It is
not necessary to have any special privileges (root or cell_admin) to
follow these steps, but the scripts 'setup' and 'refmon/run' assume the
password for cell_admin is "-dce-".

1) Have TET available for use ; to build TET, cd to <src_tree>/test/tet
   and type build.  Then put the directory <obj_tree>/test/tet/src/posix_c/tcc
   into your path or copy the file <obj_tree>/test/tet/src/posix_c/tcc/tcc
   to some directory already in your path.

2) cd <object_tree>/test/rpc/idlcxx

3) Run the 'setup' script.  This will setup a CDS test directory and open
   permissions for anyone to write to the directory.

4) setenv TET_ROOT `pwd`

5) Kick off the tests with:
   % tcc -e -j tet_jrnl -s tet_scen -x tetexec.cfg all

The final step will look for failures and summarize which tests passed,
failed, or were missing results.
