Hierarchical Cell Configuration Test (HCLCFG001)
----------------------------------------------

The system test in this directory performs a single test function.
Using rgy_edit it attempts to setup intercell operation with one or
more specified cells. The cells which are specified must already be
accessible via a global namespace, and the gdad must be running 
in the cell in which this test is run.

This test uses a "run" control script as a test driver in the same 
way as many of the other DCE system tests. The run script is 
run.hcell, installed in the directory 

	   $TET_ROOT/system/directory/cds/bin. 

This test only needs to be installed on one machine in one cell in
order to be executed between that cell and one or more other 
cells. Installation is accomplished using dcetest_config. 

The command line syntax for this test is:

     run.hcell hclcfg001 {cells}

where cells are one or more complete cellnames separated by spaces.
