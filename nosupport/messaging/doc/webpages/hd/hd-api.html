This section describes the API for the Message Oriented Service(MOS)
integrated with DCE. MOS-API supports a message queuing model.
In a message queuing model, a source peer application sends
messages to a queue manager/queue regardless if the destination
peer application is available.
<P>

MOS-API is used by senders, recipients, and system administration
interfaces. The APIs are categorized as follows:
<UL>
  <LI> API Control
  <LI> Naming
  <LI> Conversation Management
  <LI> Security
  <LI> Marshalling
  <LI> Message Attributes Utilities
  <LI> Message Selection Utilities
  <LI> Queue Attributes Utilities
  <LI> Queue Management Utilities
</UL>


The following table describes a high-level list of functions by
category and the services offered. Note that the APIs related to
messaging specifically begin with "mos_".  

<H2>API Control</H2>
This group of interfaces performs general initialization and
cleanup of messaging and queuing facilities. They are called at 
the beginning and end of applications.


<H2>Naming</H2>
This group of interfaces manipulates the namespace where clients
advertize or find messaging and queuing services.
<P>

In DCE, naming is achieved via the RPC Naming Service Interface(NSI).
MOS-API provides an interface to attach and detach to resources as
well as creating groups of resources. A resource is a name in the
namespace that may be a queue, a Q-mgr, a destination peer application,
a specific NSI entry, group, or profile name.
<P>

In MOS-API, name syntaxes are hardcoded as "rpc_c_ns_syntax_default".
<P>

For seasoned DCE application writers, the RPC-API may be used for
manipulating NSI entries, groups, and profiles. For example, if
a messaging application requires to work with profiles, then
the RPC-API may be used.


<H2>Conversation Management</H2>
This group of interfaces do the actual work of getting messages
from senders to recipients. Also, interfaces to send messages to 
groups of recipients are provided.


<H2>Security</H2>
MOS-API adheres to the model specified in DCE Security AES. MOS-API 
provides an interface for an end-to-end protection level and a means 
to identify initial senders to recipients.
<P>

In MOS-API, the authorization service is hardcoded as
"rpc_c_authz_dce". The authentication service is hardcoded as
"rpc_c_authn_dce_secret".
<P>

DCE Security may be used for manipulating acls on queues or
queue managers, creating security groups of queue managers,
and so forth.


<H2>Marshalling</H2>
At the lowest level, hidden from the programmers,
simple arrays of bytes are sent from sender to recipient processes.
We provide straightforward mechanisms to employ IDL-generated serialization
functions so structured data can be sent via the messaging services.


<H2>Message Attributes Utilities</H2>
This group of interfaces allow manipulation of attributes on messages.
There are separate interfaces to set and get each attribute.
<P>

Once a message and its corresponding message attributes are sent, neither 
the message nor its message attributes can be modified.


<H2>Message Selection Utilities</H2>
This group of interfaces allow manipulation of selection criteria on
messages to be retrieved. 
<P>


<H2>Queue Attributes Utilities</H2>
This group of interfaces allow manipulation of attributes on queues themselves.
There are separate interfaces to set and get each attribute.


<H2>Queue Management Utilities</H2>
This group of interfaces allow administration of queues.
