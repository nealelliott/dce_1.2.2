<H2>Target Audience</H2>

This document is meant for marketing and sales people who are interested
in really high level description of the project.
<P>
<HR>

DCE offers a rich environment of integrated services for distributed
computing based upon RPC.  Some distributed applications, however, are
more naturally implemented via an asynchronous, messaging paradigm.
<P>

The goal of this project is to integrate messaging into the DCE
infrastructure creating a common, coherent environment for both RPC
and message oriented distributed computational models. The uniformed
environment will provide a common base for application developers, as well
as to ease the administration tasks for administrators.
<P>

DCE Messaging will use the DCE naming model, which provides a
distributed naming environment where logical names are used in place
of physical names to provide applications with a location transparent
support. With DCE naming support, DCE messaging can provide location
independent message passing and queuing functionality.
<P>

DCE security will be used. Authenticated messaging with authorization
support will make it possible for secured messaging operations. 
<P>

The outcome of the project will consist of four parts:
<UL>
<LI>a set of APIs that allows an application to submit an arbitrarily
complex typed message to be sent to a destination securely, with
naming support.

<LI>an infrastructure for a message queuing system (MQS) where messages
are stored and possibly forwarded among queue managers. 

<LI>a set of administration commands, in the dcecp terms, which users
and administrators can use to operate on queues and messages.

<LI>a proof-of-concept implementation of a distributed application using
the DCE messaging prototype.
</UL>
