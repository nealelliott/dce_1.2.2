This document describes a model for a distributed messaging
infrastructure that meets the goals stated in [High Level Goals].  The
infrastructure includes services for secure message-based
communication with location-independent naming.
<P>
One of the goals is to integrate messaging with DCE, consequently, the
security, naming and messaging models will be consistent with and
extend that of DCE.


<H2>Introduction</H2>
Providing a means for applications to communicate is a fundamental
service of any distributed computing infrastructure.  One method,
which is analogous to inter-process communication mechanisms typically
available within a single system, is message exchange.  A message is a
unit of data that one application process may send to other
application processes.  The size, content and significance of a
message is determined by the communicating application processes.
<P>
Viewed from the highest level, there are three components of interest
in the messaging environment: those that use the messaging service;
those that the messaging service uses; and the messaging service
itself. Each of these will be described in more detail in later
sections.
<P>
There are primarily two types of message service users: senders and
receivers of messages; and administrators.  A sender is a process
which calls upon the messaging service to communicate a message to
other processes.  A receiver is a process which calls upon the
messaging service to retrieve messages that were sent by other
processes.  A process may be both a sender and a receiver.  An
administrator controls the configuration and operation of the
messaging service.  The services provided by the messaging system to
support these usage types are each described separately.
<P>
The messaging system itself provides services through two interfaces,
one for message communication and related functions, and one for
administration.  Internally, the system is logically partitioned into
the components which support the interfaces local to an individual
system, queue managers, and queues.  There may be multiple instances
of each of these components as described later.
<P>
The messaging system makes use of data transmission, marshaling,
naming, and security services provided by the underlying computing
environment, in this case, DCE.


<H2>Message Communication</H2>
The messaging service allows senders and receivers to execute
concurrently and to send and receive messages asynchronously.  Two
forms of asynchronous message communication to consider are message
queuing and message passing.  The focus of this work is to build a
message queuing system, therefore, message passing will only be
mentioned to illustrate some of the differences between queuing versus
passing.  To adequately describe these forms of message communication,
some of the components of the messaging system must first be described
in more detail.
<P>

<H3> Messaging System Components </H3>
For the purpose of defining message passing and queuing, the following
components and their properties are relevant.

<H4> Communication Interface </H4>
All operations necessary for message communication are provided by the
messaging system application programming interface (API).  There must
be an instance of this interface (and associated underpinnings
required to support the operations) on the same system as each sender
and each receiver.

<H4> Queue </H4>
A queue is a container for 0 or more messages.  The messaging system
may have 0 or more (instances of) queues.  The location of a queue
(system on which a queue physically resides) is independent of the
number and location of the communication APIs.  The number and
location of queues may vary over time.

<H4> Queue Manager </H4>
A queue manager controls 0 or more queues.  This control includes
creation and destruction of queues, insertion and removal of messages
from a queue, saving messages in a persistent data store to protect
against failures, and all other operations on queues.  The messaging
system may have 0 or more (instances of) queue managers.  The location
of a queue manager is independent of the number and location of the
communication interfaces, however, there must exist at least one
communication channel between each interface instance and each queue
manager.  The number and location of queue managers may vary over
time.

Each queue is controlled by exactly one queue manager.  The physical
location of a queue is an implementation detail.  Logically, a queue
can be thought of as being colocated with its controlling queue
manager.

<H3>Message Queuing</H3>
In message queuing, a sender calls its local messaging interface to
store messages in a queue.  Similarly, a receiver calls its local
messaging interface to retrieve messages from a queue.  The messaging
system provides the necessary functions to move the messages from the
sender to the queue and from the queue to receivers.  The sender may
enqueue messages at any rate and a receiver may dequeue them at any
rate.
<P>
Note that, unlike message passing, senders and receivers need neither
be available simultaneously nor have a direct communication channel
between their messaging interfaces.  The sender may enqueue messages
while the receiver is not available or non-existent, and the receiver
may later dequeue these messages after the sender is no longer
available or has been terminated.
<P>
Each call to the messaging interface directs a message to one or more
queues.  Multiple senders may enqueue messages to a queue and multiple
receivers may dequeue messages from a queue.

<H3>Message Passing</H3>
In message passing, a sender calls its local messaging API to send
messages to a receiver which also calls its local messaging API to
retrieve these messages.  The messaging system provides the necessary
functions to move the messages from the sender to the receiver.  The
sender may send messages at any rate and a receiver may retrieve them
at any rate, however, both the sender and receiver must be available
during this transfer and there must exist a communication channel
between the sending and receiving messaging interface components.  If
the availability and communication requirements are not met, then it
is likely that the messages will be lost.


<H2>Quality of Service</H2>
The message queuing system provides various service qualities for
handling messages.

<H3> Delivery Notification </H3>

<H4>Message Queuing</H4>
Three delivery notices are available to a message queuing sender:
<OL>
<LI> None.
<LI> Queued.
<LI> Dequeued.
</OL>

The sender may request one of: None; Queued; Dequeued; or, Queued and Dequeued.
<P>
<DL>
<DT>None.
<DD>
The messaging system makes a best effort attempt to store the message
in a queue.  Zero or more copies of the message may be stored in the
queue.  No notification is provided to the sender.
<P>
<DT>Queued.
<DD>
The messaging system notifies the sender that the message was stored
in a queue exactly one time as long as neither the sending system nor
the queue manager handling the destination queue fail.  Transient
failure of other systems will not cause failure to store the message
in a queue.  If either the sender does not receive a notification or
the sender receives a failure notification, then the message may have
been stored in a queue either once or not at all.
<P>
<DT>Dequeued.
<DD>
The messaging system notifies the sender that the message was removed
from the queue and the reason for removal.  The reason may be that a
receiver retrieved the message, that the message was discarded by the
messaging system, or that some failure occurred.
</DL>

<H3> API styles </H3>
The messaging API supports both synchronous and asynchronous styles of
programming.
<P>
For queued and dequeued notifications, the sender may request either
that notification be returned on the enqueue call to the messaging
interface and whether to wait for space to be freed if the queue is
full, or that the notification be stored in a queue specified by the
sender for subsequent retrieval.
<P>
<H3> Persistence </H3>
A sender may request persistent queuing of a message.  A message sent
with persistent handling must be placed in stable storage such that
the message is not lost from the queue due to a failure of the system
on which queue manager resides.  If persistent queuing is requested,
then the message must be saved in the persistent store before sending
success notification to the sender if any was requested.
<P>
Note that the message is protected from loss only while it is stored in
the queue.  Once the message is removed from the queue (as part of a
receiver dequeue operation for example), the message safety is no
longer guaranteed.


<H2>Message Order</H2>
The order in which messages are stored in a queue may be partially
determined by the sender.  Unless otherwise specified by the sender,
messages are transmitted from the communications interface in the
order most convenient for the messaging system.  In particular, the
messaging system may choose to reorder or send multiple messages
concurrently.
<P>
When executing dequeue requests from receivers, a queue manager will
remove messages for return to the receivers in the same order in which
the messages were stored by the queue manager (i.e. FIFO) unless
otherwise specified by the sender.
<P>
A sender may choose from the following handling options to alter
message deliver order.

<H4>Priority Queuing</H4>
A sender may specify a priority for the handling of a message when
making an enqueue call.  A queue manager will always dequeue messages
in order of priority.  Within a given a priority, the queue manger
removes messages from a queue in FIFO order.

<H4>Timed Dequeuing</H4>
A sender may request that a message cannot be retrieved from the queue
by a receiver before a specified time.  When the specified time is
reached, a queue manager handles the message as though it had been
received from the sender at the specified time.


<H2>Naming</H2>
The messaging system provides the same set of flexible naming
operations as found in DCE.  For example, queues, services, servers,
people, places, resources and other objects can be given location
independent names that are used to determine where messages will be
sent.
<P>
There are 4 attributes which can be associated with a name in any
combination: Profile, Object, Group, and Binding.  Refer to chapters
2.4 and 6.2.3 of the DCE AES for the syntax, operations and algorithms
provided for manipulating these attributes and determining message
destinations.
<P>
Part of messaging application design includes determining how to use
these operations and attributes in way that is meaningful for the
users of the application.
<P>
Because queues are resources provided and controlled by queue
managers, the names of queues are composite names.  These composite
names are formed from a "junction" name that identifies the queue
manager along with a name for a queue that is local to that queue
manager.
<P>
The structure of these names is transparent to users in that junctions
are traversed automatically by the messaging system.

<H2>Security</H2>
The messaging service adheres to the model specified in the DCE
Security AES, and protects resources as described below.
<P>
The sender and receiver may both specify the end-to-end level of
protection for messages.  The messaging system must guarantee that the
requested protection is enforced by not allowing a receiver to dequeue
a message unless the stronger of the protection levels requested by
both the sender and receiver are satisfied.
<P>
The protection levels provided by the messaging service and two
methods of enforcing the requested protection are given below.

<H3> Protection Levels </H3>
The choices that both sender and receiver have for protection level
are listed below in order of weakest to strongest:

<OL>
<LI> None
<LI> Authentication
<LI> Authentication and Data Integrity
<LI> Authentication, Data Integrity and Privacy
</OL>

<DL>
<DT>None
<DD>
The messaging service provides no protection.
<P>
<DT>Authentication
<DD>
The messaging service guarantees that the sender of a message is
correctly identified to a receiver.  It is the receiver's
responsibility to determine a sender's authorization based upon this
identity.  In addition, the following checks are made:
<UL>
 <LI>For a message queuing sender, the queue manager principal identity
  or group membership is verified for enqueue operations.
 <LI>For a message queuing receiver, the queue manager principal
  identity or group membership is verified for dequeue operations.
</UL>
<P>
<DT>Authentication and Data Integrity
<DD>
In addition to the authentication guarantee, the message is protected
from any form of modification including addition or deletion of data.
<P>
<DT>Authentication, Data Integrity and Privacy
<DD>
In addition to Authentication and Data Integrity, the message data is
protected such that it can only be read by authorized receivers.  This
includes protection against eavesdropping on the communication
channels used by the messaging service.
<P>
The level of protection provided for a delivery notification will be
at least as great as that requested for the message to which it
corresponds.
</DL>

<H3> Enforcement </H3>
Ideally, message protection is provided by a trusted service that is
external to the messaging service so that queue managers need not be
part of the trusted computing base.
<P>
If such a service is not available, the messaging API components and
the queue managers must be part of the trusted computing base.
Senders and receivers rely on their messaging API components to
enforce the requested protection level in all communications among
these components and the queue managers.  Also, the queue manager must
maintain the requested protection for all messages sent to and
received from messaging components, and for those messages stored in
queues.

<H3> Access Control </H3>
Control over the creation, destruction and operational behavior of
queues and queue managers is determined by access control lists (ACL).
The DCE Security AES specifies general the definition and use of ACLs.

<H4>Queue Manager ACLs</H4>
Each queue manager ACL provides five permissions:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Control.  Permission to modify the ACL.
<P>
<LI> Queue Creation.  Permission to create queues.
<P>
<LI> Queue Management.  Permission to control queue behavior and
   operation such enabling and disabling queuing or message
   persistence.
<P>
<LI> Queue Status Query. Permission to access queue information on the
   queue manager.
<P>
<LI> Test.  Permission to check attributes of a queue manager and its queues.
</UL>

<H4>Queue ACLs</H4>
Each queue ACL provides ten permissions:
<UL>
<P>
<LI> Control.  Permission to modify the ACL.
<P>
<LI> Queue Deletion. Permission to delete the queue.
<P>
<LI> Queue Management.  Permission to control queue behavior and
   operation (attributes) such enabling and disabling queuing or
   modifying queue attributes.
<P>
<LI> Read Queue Attributes.  Permission to read queue attributes.
<P>
<LI> Enqueue Message.  Permission to add a message to a queue.
<P>
<LI> Dequeue Message.  Permission to remove a message from a queue.
<P>
<LI> Purge Messages. Permission to purge/delete a message (without reading its
   data).
<P>
<LI> Test.  Permission to check attributes of a queue or of messages in
   the queue.
</UL>


<H2>Marshaling</H2>
It is often the case that the information to be transmitted in a
message is a data structure.  In addition, various systems may each
employ a different representation of simple data types.  Determining
how to encode and decode information in messages can be a tedious and
error prone task which is automated by the messaging service.
<P>
The messaging service employs the DCE encoding services to handle this
data marshaling and unmarshaling.  Using DCE Interface Definition
Language (IDL), a messaging application defines the structure of the
messages it will send and receive.
<P>
To send a message, the sender points to the data to be included in the
message and indicates the message structure.  The messaging system will
encode this data structure for transmission.
<P>
The receiver of the message is provided with an indication of the data
structure that is encoded within the message.  The receiver may then
invoke the decoding service to extract the information into a local
representation of the structure.
