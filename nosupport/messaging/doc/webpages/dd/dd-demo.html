For the demo work, we are going to implement a travel reimbursement (or a
timecard) system where the requester can use a GUI interface to fill out a
form and then send the form to his manager (manager's queue). The manager,
also using a GUI interface, can login in to check new requests. He can then
either approve the request (in this case, an approval message is sent to the
original requester, and a new form is forwarded to the account payable dept),
or he can deny the request by sending the form back to the requester. The
accountant checks the messages and issues check to the requester.
<P>

To help showing the prototype, we believe it is useful if we also implement 
a GUI based interface which shows what is going on in the MQ system. It will
be a GUI wrapper to show the information that you can obtain through the
dcecp commands.
