Details for migration testing

    Verify the migration compatibility of DCE R1.2.2.  Details are in ATTACH 1.

    In this section, the trigger of modifying the registry database is
    typing commands manually.
    It is difficult to replace above method to convenient scripts.

    Basic test plan of this term is:
    - verify if the registry database can be automatically converted
      by installing DCE R1.2.2 bits
    - verify if the global group operations are available after moving the
      cell's Security Registry to dce1.2.2 format by the following operation:

          dcecp> registry modify -version secd.dce.1.2.2

GLOBALGROUP TEST SCENARIO (migration testing)

1. Prerequisites

    Migration tests require two cells consisting of three nodes at minimum.
    One of the cells must have a master and a slave replica server.
    The other must have a master replica server.

	cL	local cell (cell on the local host).
		This cell will have a master and a slave replica server.
	cR	remote cell (cell on the remote host)

    NOTICE:
	In each scenario, pre-DCE R1.2.2 bits must be installed in all
	the testing nodes.


2. Test Scenario
2.1 Setting up test condition

    Create a group and accounts into the local cell like bellow;

	dcecp> group create gG
	dcecp> principal create pL
	dcecp> principal create pLa
	dcecp> account create pL -group none -organization none
	dcecp> account create pLa -group none -organization none

	- gG means a group object which will include foreign principals
	- pL means a principal object which belongs to the local cell
	- pLa means another principal object which belongs to the local cell

    Create an account into the remote cell like bellow;

	dcecp> principal create pR
	dcecp> account create pR -group none -organization none

	- pR means a principal object which belongs to the remote cell

    After this operation, enable the cells to show each name space using
    "dcecp cdscache create", and connect to remote cell using
    "dcecp registry connect".

    And, add the slave replica server on the cell /.../cL.


2.2 Details for testing

    Here are a scenario diagram for migration testing.

    The basic procedures are:
    (1) install pre-DCE R1.2.2 bits to all the testing node in the local cell
    (2) modify the registry database by some local member operation
    (3) install DCE R1.2.2 bits, and verify if the database can be automatically
	converted
    (4) modify the registry database by some global group operation, and
	verify if the operation to be rejected as error "Object not found"
    (5) move the cell's Security Registry to "dce1.2.2" operation using
	`dcecp registry modify -version'
    (6) if any replica servers are not capable of supporting the new software
	version, verify that the master replica propagates a stop request to
	those replicas
    (7) install DCE R1.2.2 bits to the slave replica node which the master
	replica has shut down
    (8) modify the registry database by some global group operation, and
	verify that the operation be succeed

    In the diagram below, `GG operation' means to modify registry database
    by adding or removing global principals as a group member.

(1) login to the cell cL as a cell_admin

	dce_login cell_admin

(2) add the local principal pL as a member of the group gG

	rgy_edit> domain g
	rgy_edit> member gG -a pL

(3) verify that group gG has a member above

	rgy_edit> domain g
	rgy_edit> view gG -m

(4) STOP the cell /.../cL

	dce_config
